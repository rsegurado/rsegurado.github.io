TI  - Antidepressant Use and Orthostatic Hypotension in Older Adults Living with 
      Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer Disease.
LID - 10.1002/gps.5377 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antidepressant use is often reported as a risk factor for Orthostatic 
      Hypotension (OH), however this relationship has never been explored in those with 
      mild/moderate Alzheimer Disease (AD), who may represent a particularly vulnerable 
      cohort. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the 
      NILVAD study. Participants with mild-moderate AD were recruited from 23 centres in 9 
      countries. Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (SBP/DBP) was recorded in the 
      seated position and after both 1 & 5 minutes of standing. OH was defined as a drop 
      of ≥20 mmHg SBP/≥ 10 mmHg DBP. We examined the relationship between antidepressant 
      use, orthostatic BP drop and the presence of OH, controlling for important 
      covariates. RESULTS: Of 509 participants (72.9 ± 8.3 years, 61.9% female), 
      two-fifths (39.1%; 199/509) were prescribed a regular antidepressant. Antidepressant 
      use was associated with a significantly greater SBP and DBP drop at 5 minutes (β: 
      1.83, 0.16-3.50, P = 0.03 for SBP; β: 1.13, 0.02-2.25, P < 0.05 for DBP). Selective 
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) use was associated with a significantly greater 
      likelihood of OH (OR 2.0, 1.1-3.6, P = 0.02). Both findings persisted following 
      robust covariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with AD, antidepressants 
      were associated with a significantly greater SBP/DBP drop at 5 minutes. SSRI use in 
      particular may be a risk factor for OH. This emphasises the need to screen older 
      antidepressant users, and particularly those with AD, for ongoing orthostatic 
      symptoms in order to reduce the risk of falls in this vulnerable cohort. This

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Enhanced clinical outcomes in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit 
      following standardisation of analgesia and sedation practice are reported. Little is 
      known about the impact of standardisation of analgesia and sedation practice 
      including incorporation of a validated distress assessment instrument on infants 
      post cardiac surgery, a subset of whom have Trisomy 21. This study investigated 
      whether the parallel introduction of nurse-led analgesia and sedation guidelines 
      including regular distress assessment would impact on morphine administered to 
      infants post cardiac surgery, and whether any differences observed would be 
      amplified within the Trisomy 21 population. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective single 
      centre before/after study design was used. Patients aged between 44 weeks 
      postconceptual age and one year old who had open cardiothoracic surgery were 
      included. RESULTS: 61 patients before and 64 patients after the intervention were 
      included. After the intervention, a reduction in the amount of morphine administered 
      was not evident, while greater use of adjuvant sedatives and analgesics was 
      observed. Patients with Trisomy 21 had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation 
      after the change in practice. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study affirm the 
      importance of the nurses' role in managing prescribed analgesia and sedation 
      supported by best available evidence. A continued education and awareness focus on 
      analgesia and sedation management in the pursuit of best patient care is imperative.

TI  - Rehabilitation strategies following oesophagogastric and Hepatopancreaticobiliary 
      cancer (ReStOre II): a protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 415
LID - 10.1186/s12885-020-06889-z [doi]
LID - 415
AB  - BACKGROUND: Curative treatment for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and 
      hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) cancers, involves complex surgical resection often in 
      combination with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemo/chemoradiotherapy. With advancing 
      survival rates, there is an emergent cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors with 
      physical and nutritional deficits, resultant from both the cancer and its 
      treatments. Therefore, rehabilitation to counteract these impairments is required to 
      maximise health related quality of life (HRQOL) in survivorship. The initial 
      feasibility of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for UGI survivors was 
      established in the Rehabilitation Strategies following Oesophago-gastric Cancer 
      (ReStOre) feasibility study and pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). ReStOre II 
      will now further investigate the efficacy of that programme as it applies to a wider 
      cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors, namely survivors of cancer of the 
      oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, and liver. METHODS: The ReStOre II RCT will compare a 
      12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme of supervised and self-managed 
      exercise, dietary counselling, and education to standard survivorship care in a 
      cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors who are > 3-months post-oesophagectomy/ 
      gastrectomy/ pancreaticoduodenectomy, or major liver resection. One hundred twenty 
      participants (60 per study arm) will be recruited to establish a mean increase in 
      the primary outcome (cardiorespiratory fitness) of 3.5 ml/min/kg with 90% power, 5% 
      significance allowing for 20% drop out. Study outcomes of physical function, body 
      composition, nutritional status, HRQOL, and fatigue will be measured at baseline 
      (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3-months follow-up (T2). At 1-year follow-up (T3), 
      HRQOL alone will be measured. The impact of ReStOre II on well-being will be 
      examined qualitatively with focus groups/interviews (T1, T2). Bio-samples will be 
      collected from T0-T2 to establish a national UGI and HPB cancer survivorship 
      biobank. The cost effectiveness of ReStOre II will also be analysed. DISCUSSION: 
      This RCT will investigate the efficacy of a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation 
      programme for survivors of UGI and HPB cancer compared to standard survivorship 
      care. If effective, ReStOre II will provide an exemplar model of rehabilitation for 
      UGI and HPB cancer survivors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number: NCT03958019, date registered: 21/05/2019.

TI  - Is Ongoing Anticholinergic Burden Associated With Greater Cognitive Decline and 
      Dementia Severity in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease?
PG  - 987-994
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glz244 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of anticholinergic medication is associated with an increased risk 
      of cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Despite this, the impact of continuing 
      medication with anticholinergic properties in those diagnosed with Alzheimer's 
      Disease (AD) is not clear. METHODS: Analysis of data from NILVAD, an 18-month 
      randomized controlled trial of Nilvadipine in AD. Effects of ongoing Anticholinergic 
      Cognitive Burden (ACB) on cognition (ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Cog Subsection) 
      and dementia severity (CDR-sb: Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes/DAD: 
      Disability Assessment for Dementia) over 18 months was evaluated adjusting for 
      important clinical covariates. RESULTS: Just over one-quarter (27.90%, n = 142/510) 
      of patients with mild to moderate AD were prescribed a potential/definite 
      anticholinergic. While ACB score was not associated with greater progression on the 
      ADAS-Cog/CDR-sb over time, a higher total ACB predicted greater dementia severity on 
      the DAD, which persisted after robust covariate adjustment (β Coef: -1.53, 95% CI: 
      -2.83 to -0.23, p = .021). There was a significant interaction between APOE ε4 
      status and ACB score, with carriers experiencing greater progression on both the 
      CDR-Sb (β Coef: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.05-0.67, p = .021) and DAD (β Coef: -3.84, 95% CI: 
      -7.65 to 0.03, p = .049). CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing use of anticholinergic medication was 
      associated with greater dementia progression on the DAD, but not the CDR-sb. APOE ε 
      4 carriers may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of ongoing anticholinergic 
      medication on dementia severity, with significant APOE ε 4 x ACB score interactions 
      demonstrated on both the DAD and CDR-sb.

TI  - Gait speed, cognition and falls in people living with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 
      disease: data from NILVAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that slower gait speed is longitudinally 
      associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and falls in older adults. Despite 
      this, the longitudinal relationship between gait speed, cognition and falls in those 
      with a diagnosis of dementia remains poorly explored. We sought to assess this 
      longitudinal relationship in a cohort of older adults with mild to-moderate 
      Alzheimer Disease (AD). METHODS: Analysis of data from NILVAD, an 18-month 
      randomised-controlled trial of Nilvadipine in mild to moderate AD. We examined: (i) 
      the cross-sectional (baseline) association between slow gait speed and cognitive 
      function, (ii) the relationship between baseline slow gait speed and cognitive 
      function at 18 months (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale, Cognitive Subsection: 
      ADAS-Cog), (iii) the relationship between baseline cognitive function and incident 
      slow gait speed at 18 months and finally (iv) the relationship of baseline slow gait 
      speed and incident falls over the study period. RESULTS: Overall, one-tenth (10.03%, 
      N = 37/369) of participants with mild-to-moderate AD met criteria for slow gait 
      speed at baseline and a further 14.09% (N = 52/369) developed incident slow gait 
      speed at 18 months. At baseline, there was a significant association between poorer 
      cognition and slow gait speed (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09, p = 0.025). Whilst there 
      was no association between baseline slow gait speed and change in ADAS-Cog score at 
      18 months, a greater cognitive severity at baseline predicted incident slow gait 
      speed over 18 months (OR 1.04, 1.01-1.08, p = 0.011). Further, slow gait speed at 
      baseline was associated with a significant risk of incident falls over the study 
      period, which persisted after covariate adjustment (IRR 3.48, 2.05-5.92, p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Poorer baseline cognition was associated with both baseline and 
      incident slow gait speed. Slow gait speed was associated with a significantly 
      increased risk of falls over the study period. Our study adds further evidence to 
      the complex relationship between gait and cognition in this vulnerable group and 
      highlights increased falls risk in older adults with AD and slow gait speed. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: Secondary analysis of the NILVAD trial (Clincaltrials.gov NCT02017340; 
      EudraCT number 2012-002764-27). First registered: 20/12/2013.

TI  - Therapeutic Listening for Preterm Children with Sensory Dysregulation, Attention and 
      Cognitive Problems.
PG  - 4
AB  - Introduction Is Therapeutic Listening effective for children born preterm presenting 
      with sensory dysregulation, attention and cognitive problems? Methods 22 children 
      (BW<1500g) 3-4 years were enrolled in a single centre, prospective, assessor-blinded 
      RTC. Outcome measures: Winnie-Dunn Sensory Profile; Peabody Developmental Motor 
      Scales; Reynell Attention Scale; Preschool Language Scales - 3; RAPT; WPPSI - IV; 
      Parent Review Questionnaires. Results The intervention group (n=9) showed better 
      improvement in sensory processing, compared to controls (n=9) (6.4 fold improvement 
      in sensation seeking; 5.0 in auditory processing; 4.0 in tactile processing). Six 
      intervention children (67%) improved in vestibular processing. Attention levels 
      improved for 9 (100%) children in the intervention group and for 7 (78%) in the 
      control group. Higher level domains (Peabody motor skills, Auditory Comprehension, 
      Expressive Communication, RAPT scale, and WPPSI scores) showed mixed results. 
      Parents reported positive changes in their child's development. Conclusion 
      Therapeutic Listening (TL) is a feasible intervention for preterm children to 
      improve attention levels and sensory processing skills.

TI  - Limited Impact of Fetal Sex and Maternal Body Mass Index on Fetal and Maternal 
      Insulin Resistance and Lipid Metabolism: Findings from the PEARs Study.
PG  - 513-522
LID - 10.1007/s43032-019-00045-0 [doi]
AB  - The intrauterine environment can have a significant impact on fetal and maternal 
      well-being, both during pregnancy and in later life. We aimed to identify how fetal 
      sex and maternal body mass index (BMI) influence insulin resistance and metabolic 
      function during pregnancy with maternal BMI > 25 kg/m(2). This secondary analysis 
      assessed data from the PEARS-randomized controlled trial that recruited pregnant 
      women with body mass indexes 25-39.9 kg/m(2). Longitudinal measurements of maternal 
      and fetal insulin resistance and metabolic function were recorded throughout 
      pregnancy. Regression models tested the effects of fetal sex and maternal BMI on 
      markers of metabolic function and insulin regulation. A total of 484 women and their 
      newborns (252 (52%) males vs. 232 (48%) females) were included in the analysis. A 
      total of 333 (69%) women were overweight and 151 (31%) were obese. Male newborns 
      were heavier and larger than females, and had a higher rate of instrumental 
      delivery. Males had a lower LDL, but no other markers of insulin resistance or 
      metabolic function were affected by fetal sex. Women with obesity had elevated 
      markers of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction compared with women that 
      were overweight, but maternal BMI did not impact these variables in the fetus. Fetal 
      sex did not impact maternal and fetal metabolic parameters in women with BMI 
      > 25 kg/m(2). However, a higher BMI caused increasingly deranged maternal blood 
      lipid concentrations and markers of insulin resistance as pregnancy progressed. 
      Lipid monitoring and interventions to reduce lipids during pregnancy therefore 
      require further evaluation.

TI  - The association between benzodiazepine use and falls, and the impact of sleep 
      quality on this association: data from the TILDA study.
PG  - 31-36
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcz217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepines (BZD) are associated with adverse effects, particularly 
      in older adults. AIM: This study assesses the association between BZD use and falls, 
      and the impact of sleep quality on this association, in community dwelling adults 
      aged over 50. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from wave 1 of The Irish 
      Longitudinal Study on Ageing. METHODS: Participants were classed as BZD users or 
      non-users and asked if they had fallen in the last year, and whether any falls were 
      unexplained. Sleep quality was assessed via self-reported trouble falling asleep, 
      daytime somnolence and early-rising. Logistic regression assessed for an association 
      between BZD use and falls, and the impact of sleep quality on this association was 
      assessed by categorizing based on BZD use and sleep quality variables. RESULTS: Of 
      8175 individuals, 302 (3.69%) reported taking BZDs. BZD use was associated with 
      falls, controlling for confounders [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.40; 1.08, 1.82; P-value 
      0.012]. There was no significant association between BZDs and unexplained falls, 
      controlling for confounders [OR 1.41; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.95, 2.10; 
      P-value 0.09]. Participants who use BZDs and report daytime somnolence (OR 1.93; 95% 
      CI 1.12, 3.31; P-value 0.017), early-rising (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.20, 3.11; P-value 
      0.007) or trouble falling asleep (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.12, 2.97; P-value 0.015), have 
      an increased odds of unexplained falls. CONCLUSION: BZD use is associated with 
      falls, with larger effect size in those reporting poor sleep quality in community 
      dwelling older adults. Appropriate prescription of medications such as BZDs is an

TI  - Is there an app for that? A cluster randomised controlled trial of a mobile 
      app-based mental health intervention.

AB  - Demand for the use of mobile apps in mental health interventions has grown in recent 
      years, particularly among adolescents who experience elevated levels of distress. 
      However, there is a scarcity of evidence for the effectiveness of these tools within 
      this population. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of CopeSmart, a 
      mental health mobile app, using a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial 
      design. Participants were 15-18-years-olds (N = 560) recruited from 10 schools 
      randomly assigned to an intervention or control condition. Intervention participants 
      used the app over a 4-week period. Multi-level modelling analyses revealed no 
      significant changes in the intervention group from pre-test to post-test, when 
      compared to the control group, in terms of emotional distress, well-being, emotional 
      self-awareness or coping strategies. Findings suggest that a 4-week app-based 
      intervention may not be enough to elicit intra-personal changes in mental health 
      outcomes in a general adolescent population.

TI  - Impact of maternal education on response to lifestyle interventions to reduce 
      gestational weight gain: individual participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - e025620
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025620 [doi]
LID - e025620
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify if maternal educational attainment is a prognostic factor 
      for gestational weight gain (GWG), and to determine the differential effects of 
      lifestyle interventions (diet based, physical activity based or mixed approach) on 
      GWG, stratified by educational attainment. DESIGN: Individual participant data 
      meta-analysis using the previously established International Weight Management in 
      Pregnancy (i-WIP) Collaborative Group database 
      (https://iwipgroup.wixsite.com/collaboration). Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis of Individual Participant Data Statement 
      guidelines were followed. DATA SOURCES: Major electronic databases, from inception 
      to February 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials on diet and 
      physical activity-based interventions in pregnancy. Maternal educational attainment 
      was required for inclusion and was categorised as higher education (≥tertiary) or 
      lower education (≤secondary). RISK OF BIAS: Cochrane risk of bias tool was used. 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Principle measures of effect were OR and regression coefficient. 
      RESULTS: Of the 36 randomised controlled trials in the i-WIP database, 21 trials and 
      5183 pregnant women were included. Women with lower educational attainment had an 
      increased risk of excessive (OR 1.182; 95% CI 1.008 to 1.385, p =0.039) and 
      inadequate weight gain (OR 1.284; 95% CI 1.045 to 1.577, p =0.017). Among women with 
      lower education, diet basedinterventions reduced risk of excessive weight gain (OR 
      0.515; 95% CI 0.339 to 0.785, p = 0.002) and inadequate weight gain (OR 0.504; 
      95% CI 0.288 to 0.884, p=0.017), and reduced kg/week gain (B -0.055; 95% CI -0.098 
      to -0.012, p=0.012). Mixed interventions reduced risk of excessive weight gain for 
      women with lower education (OR 0.735; 95% CI 0.561 to 0.963, p=0.026). Among women 
      with high education, diet based interventions reduced risk of excessive weight gain 
      (OR 0.609; 95% CI 0.437 to 0.849, p=0.003), and mixed interventions reduced kg/week 
      gain (B -0.053; 95% CI -0.069 to -0.037,p<0.001). Physical activity based 
      interventions did not impact GWG when stratified by education. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant 
      women with lower education are at an increased risk of excessive and inadequate GWG. 
      Diet based interventions seem the most appropriate choice for these women, and 
      additional support through mixed interventions may also be beneficial.

TI  - Cognitive Outcomes of Long-term Benzodiazepine and Related Drug (BDZR) Use in People 
      Living With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease: Results From NILVAD.
PG  - 194-200
LID - S1525-8610(19)30615-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jamda.2019.08.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Benzodiazepines and related drugs (BDZRs) have been associated with an 
      increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in later life. Despite this, it remains 
      unclear whether ongoing BDZR use may further accelerate cognitive decline in those 
      diagnosed with mild to moderate AD. DESIGN: This study was embedded within NILVAD, a 
      randomized controlled trial of nilvadipine in mild to moderate AD. Cognition was 
      measured at baseline and 18 months using the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale, 
      Cognitive Subsection (ADAS-Cog). We assessed predictors of long-term BDZR use and 
      analyzed the effect of ongoing BDZR use on ADAS-Cog scores at 18 months. 
      Additionally, the impact of BDZR use on adverse events, incident delirium, and falls 
      over 18-month follow-up was assessed adjusting for relevant covariates. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: 448 participants with mild to moderate AD recruited from 23 academic 
      centers in 9 European countries. RESULTS: Overall, 14% (62/448) were prescribed an 
      ongoing BDZR for the study duration. Increasing total number of (non-BDZR) 
      medications was associated with a greater likelihood of BDZR prescription (odds 
      ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.29). At 18 months, BDZR use was not 
      associated with greater cognitive decline on the ADAS-Cog controlling for baseline 
      ADAS-Cog scores, age, gender, study arm, and other clinical covariates 
      (β = 1.62, -1.34 to 4.56). However, ongoing BDZR use was associated with a greater 
      likelihood of adverse events [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.19, 1.05-1.34], incident 
      delirium (IRR 2.31, 1.45-3.68), and falls (IRR 1.66, 1.02-2.65) over 18 months that 
      persisted after robust adjustment for covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This 
      study found no effect of ongoing BDZR use on ADAS-Cog scores in those with mild to 
      moderate AD over 18 months. However, ongoing use of these medications was associated 
      with an increased risk of adverse events, delirium, and falls. Thus, BDZR use should 
      be avoided where possible and deprescribing interventions should be encouraged in 
      older adults with AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobilization of community first responders (CFRs) to the scene of an 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) event has been proposed as a means of 
      shortening the interval from occurrence of cardiac arrest to performance of 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation, thereby increasing patient 
      survival. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of mobilizing community first responders 
      (CFRs) to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events in adults and children older than 
      four weeks of age, in terms of survival and neurological function. SEARCH METHODS: 
      We searched the following databases for relevant trials in January 2019: CENTRAL, 
      MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), and Web of Science. We also searched the World 
      Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, and we scanned the abstracts of conference proceedings of the 
      American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials (RCTs and q-RCTs) that 
      compared routine emergency medical services (EMS) care versus EMS care plus 
      mobilization of CFRs in instances of OHCA.Trials with randomization by cluster were 
      eligible for inclusion, including cluster-design studies with intervention 
      cross-over.In some communities, the statutory ambulance service/EMS is routinely 
      provided by the local fire service. For the purposes of this review, this group 
      represents the statutory ambulance service/EMS, as distinct from CFRs, and was not 
      included as an eligible intervention.We did not include studies primarily focused on 
      opportunistic bystanders. Individuals who were present at the scene of an OHCA event 
      and who performed CPR according to telephone instruction provided by EMS call takers 
      were not considered to be CFRs.Studies primarily assessing the impact of specific 
      additional interventions such as administration of naloxone in narcotic overdose or 
      adrenaline in anaphylaxis were also excluded.We included adults and children older 
      than four weeks of age who had experienced an OHCA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      Two review authors independently reviewed all titles and abstracts received to 
      assess potential eligibility, using set inclusion criteria. We obtained and examined 
      in detail full-text copies of all papers considered potentially eligible, and we 
      approached authors of trials for additional information when necessary. We 
      summarized the process of study selection in a PRISMA flowchart.Three review authors 
      independently extracted relevant data using a standard data extraction form and 
      assessed the validity of each included trial using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. 
      We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus.We synthesized findings in 
      narrative fashion due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. We used the 
      principles of the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the body of evidence 
      associated with specific outcomes and to construct a 'Summary of findings' table. 
      MAIN RESULTS: We found two completed studies involving a total of 1136 participants 
      that ultimately met our inclusion criteria. We also found one ongoing study and one 
      planned study. We noted significant heterogeneity in the characteristics of 
      interventions and outcomes measured or reported across these studies, thus we could 
      not pool study results.One completed study considered the dispatch of police and 
      fire service CFRs equipped with automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in an EMS 
      system in Amsterdam and surrounding areas. This study was an RCT with allocation 
      made by cluster according to non-overlapping geographical regions. It was conducted 
      between 5 January 2000 and 5 January 2002. All participants were 18 years of age or 
      older and had experienced witnessed OHCA. The study found no difference in survival 
      at hospital discharge (odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 2.2; 
      1 RCT; 469 participants; low-certainty evidence), despite the observation that all 
      72 incidences of defibrillation performed before EMS arrival occurred in the 
      intervention group (OR and 95% CI - not applicable; 1 RCT; 469 participants; 
      moderate-certainty evidence). This study reported increased survival to hospital 
      admission in the intervention group (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0; 1 RCT; 469 
      participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The second completed study considered the 
      dispatch of nearby lay volunteers in Stockholm, Sweden, who were trained to perform 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This represented a supplementary CFR 
      intervention in an EMS system where police and fire services were already routinely 
      dispatched to OHCA in addition to EMS ambulances. This study, an RCT, included both 
      witnessed and unwitnessed OHCA and was conducted between 1 April 2012 and 1 December 
      2013. Participants included adults and children eight years of age and older. 
      Researchers found no difference in 30-day survival (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.29; 1 
      RCT; 612 participants; low-certainty evidence), despite a significant increase in 
      CPR performed before EMS arrival (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.03; 1 RCT; 665 
      participants; moderate-certainty evidence).Neither of the included completed studies 
      considered neurological function at hospital discharge or at 30 days, measured by 
      cerebral performance category or by any other means. Neither of the included 
      completed studies considered health-related quality of life. The overall certainty 
      of evidence for the outcomes of included studies was low to moderate. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence shows that context-specific CFR 
      interventions result in increased rates of CPR or defibrillation performed before 
      EMS arrival. It remains uncertain whether this can translate to significantly 
      increased rates of overall patient survival. When possible, further high-quality 
      RCTs that are adequately powered to measure changes in survival should be 
      conducted.The included studies did not consider survival with good neurological 
      function. This outcome is likely to be important to patients and should be included 
      routinely wherever survival is measured.We identified one ongoing study and one 
      planned trial whose results once available may change the results of this review. As 
      this review was limited to randomized and quasi-randomized trials, we may have 
      missed some important data from other study types.

TI  - Exploring Covariation between Traditional Markers of Metabolic Health and the Plasma 
      Metabolomic Profile: A Classic Twin Design.
PG  - 2613-2623
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00126 [doi]
AB  - Novel metabolomic profiling techniques combined with traditional biomarkers provide 
      knowledge of mechanisms underlying metabolic health. Twin studies describe the 
      impact of genes and environment on variation in traits. This study aims to identify 
      relationships between traditional markers of metabolic health and the plasma 
      metabolomic profile using a twin modeling approach and determine whether covariation 
      is caused by shared genetic and environmental factors. Using a classic twin design, 
      this study examined covariation between anthropometric, clinical chemistry, and 
      metabolomic profiles. Cholesky decomposition modeling was used to determine the 
      genetic and environmental path coefficients through successive anthropometric and 
      clinical chemistry traits onto metabolomic derived metabolites. This study shows 
      that WC, TAG, and a metabolomic signature composed of 7 metabolites are 
      inter-related, and that covariation can be attributed to common genetic, shared and 
      unique environmental factors as well as unique environmental factors specific to the 
      metabolite. This quantitative modeling connecting the traditional anthropometry and 
      clinical chemistry traits with the more recent and potentially more sensitive 
      metabolomic profile approach may provide further insight on the pleiotropic genes or 
      modifiable environmental factors influencing variation in metabolic health.

      individuals.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of knee joint angle and age on torque 
      steadiness of knee extensors (KE) at varying submaximal isometric contractions. 
      METHODS: 22 young (24.0 ± 2.6 years; 11 women) and 22 older (69.4 ± 2.4 years; 10 
      women) healthy men and women participated. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction 
      (MVIC) of the KE and flexors was examined at 90° and 60° of knee flexion (0° = full 
      extension). At each angle, participants performed KE isometric contractions (20%, 
      50% and 80% MVIC) to evaluate torque steadiness, whereas surface EMG was 
      concurrently acquired from the vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscles. RESULTS: 
      Age-related impairment in torque steadiness was observed only at 20% MVIC 
      (p < 0.01). A lower level of steadiness (p < 0.001) with a higher level of agonist 
      and antagonist activations (all p < 0.01) was observed at 90° of knee flexion in 
      comparison with contractions at 60°. Young participants were less steady when 
      performing contractions at 90° compared with contractions at 60° of flexion 
      (p < 0.001), whereas there was no difference for older participants. Furthermore, a 
      significant effect of agonist activation and antagonist co-activation on torque 
      steadiness was observed, but only in young participants (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that: (1) knee joint angle affects torque steadiness 
      differently in young and older individuals; (2) an age-related impairment in 
      steadiness was only presented at the lowest considered contraction intensity; and 
      (3) the muscle activation responses were not associated with steadiness in older 
      individuals.

TI  - Cesarean delivery rates using Robson classification system in Ireland: What can we

AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that the Robson Ten-Group Classification System be 
      used as a global standard for assessing, monitoring and comparing cesarean delivery 
      (CD) rates within and between maternity services. Our objective was to compare the 
      change of CD rates within the 10-Group Classification System in our institution over 
      10 years. STUDY DESIGN: From 2005-2014 inclusive data was collected prospectively 
      and all women were classified using the obstetric concepts and parameters described 
      in the Ten-Group Classification System. Linear regression and weighted Least Squares 
      regression analyses were used to analyze trends over time. RESULTS: During 2005-2014 
      inclusive, 88,004 mothers delivered 89,649 babies ≥500 g. Over the 10 year period 
      there was an increase in CD rate from 18.3% to 23.5%, with a linear increase in CD 
      rate by 0.6% annually (95% CI:0.52, 0.75;p < 0.001). The main contribution to the 
      increase in the CD rate was Group 2a (induced single cephalic nulliparous women at 
      term), Group 2b (pre-labor single cephalic nulliparous women at term) and Group 5 
      (single cephalic multiparous women at term with a previous CD). No increase in CD 
      rate was noted in Group 1 (single cephalic nulliparous women presenting in 
      spontaneous labor at term). The percentage of women ≥35 years of age increased from 
      28.4% to 39.8% over the study period (0.98% per year; 95% CI:0.64, 1.33;p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: The driving force for the increase in CD in the National Maternity 
      Hospital has been induction of labor and pre-labor CD in nulliparous women with a 
      single cephalic pregnancy at term. This inevitably results in a larger population of 
      women with a previous CD and therefore a secondary contribution to the increase in 
      the overall CD rate.

TI  - Fetal growth trajectories and their association with maternal and child 
      characteristics.
PG  - 2427-2433
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2018.1554041 [doi]
AB  - Background: The growth of the fetus is a complex process, influenced by genetic and 
      environmental factors. Longitudinal patterns of fetal growth are required to fully 
      understand this process, however to date, a paucity of data exists in this 
      area.Objective: To identify fetal growth trajectories in-utero and to assess their 
      association with maternal and child characteristics up to 5 years postnatal.Methods: 
      Data from 781 mother-child pairs from the ROLO longitudinal birth cohort study were 
      analyzed. The ROLO study was a randomized control trial of a low glycemic index diet 
      in pregnancy to prevent recurrence of macrosomia. Fetal ultrasound measurements were 
      recorded at 20 and 34 weeks gestation, and birth weight was recorded. Abdominal 
      circumference (AC), weight (fetal weight, or birth weight), a standardized proxy for 
      length (femur length or birth length, individually standardized), and AC:length 
      ratio were examined for trajectory classes using latent class trajectory mixture 
      models. Two-, three-, four-, and five-class models were evaluated for fit, using a 
      linear (first order) trajectory over three time-points. ANOVA and chi-square tests 
      were applied to test associations between trajectory membership and maternal and 
      child characteristics up to age 5.Results: For AC, two fetal growth trajectories 
      were identified, with 29% of participants on a "slow" trajectory and 71% on a "fast" 
      trajectory. Those on a fast trajectory had higher rates of maternal impaired glucose 
      tolerance (28.7 versus 16.5%, p<.001) and higher rates of mean child 5-year body 
      mass index (BMI) centiles (64th versus 58th centile, p<.05) compared to those on the 
      slow trajectory. For estimated fetal weight, four trajectories were identified, with 
      4% on a "very-slow" trajectory, 63% in a "moderate-slow" trajectory, 30% in a 
      "moderate-fast" trajectory and 3% on a "very-fast" trajectory. Mothers with a fetus 
      on the fastest trajectory had higher antenatal serum glucose levels (p<.05), and 
      were more likely to deliver by cesarean section (59.1 versus 20%, p<.001). At 5 
      years of age, children on the fastest growth trajectory had the highest mean BMI 
      centile (86th versus 60th centile, p<.05).Conclusions: This study shows that 
      specific fetal growth trajectories may be associated with maternal serum glucose 
      concentrations during pregnancy, mode of delivery and child BMI at 5 years of age. 
      Diet and lifestyle measures that target maternal glucose levels during pregnancy may 
      have lifelong benefits for children's BMI. Identifying those on an accelerated 
      growth trajectory during fetal life provides a unique opportunity for antenatal and 
      infant interventions that may have long-lasting health benefits.

TI  - Maternal protein intake during pregnancy is associated with child growth up to 5 
      years of age, but not through insulin-like growth factor-1: findings from the ROLO 
      study.
PG  - 1252-1261
LID - 10.1017/S0007114518002611 [doi]
AB  - Infant protein intake has been associated with child growth, however, research on 
      maternal protein intake during pregnancy is limited. Insulin-like growth factors 
      (IGF) play a role in early fetal development and maternal protein intake may 
      influence child body composition via IGF-1. The aim of this study was to investigate 
      the association of maternal protein intake throughout pregnancy on cord blood IGF-1 
      and child body composition from birth to 5 years of age. Analysis was carried out on 
      570 mother-child dyads from the Randomised cOntrol trial of LOw glycaemic index diet 
      study. Protein intake was recorded using 3-d food diaries in each trimester of 
      pregnancy and protein intake per kg of maternal weight (g/d per kg) was calculated. 
      Cord blood IGF-1 was measured at birth. Infant anthropometry was measured at birth, 
      6 months, 2 and 5 years of age. Mixed modelling, linear regression, and mediation 
      analysis were carried out. Birth weight centiles were positively associated with 
      early-pregnancy protein intake (g/d per kg), while weight centiles from 6 months to 
      5 years were negatively associated (B=-21·6, P<0·05). These associations were not 
      mediated by IGF-1. Our findings suggest that high protein intake in early-pregnancy 
      may exert an in utero effect on offspring body composition with a higher weight 
      initially at birth but slower growth rates into childhood. Further research is 
      needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which dietary protein modulates fetal 
      growth.

TI  - Nilvadipine in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease: A randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e1002660
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002660 [doi]
LID - e1002660
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study reports the findings of the first large-scale Phase III 
      investigator-driven clinical trial to slow the rate of cognitive decline in 
      Alzheimer disease with a dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blocker, nilvadipine. 
      Nilvadipine, licensed to treat hypertension, reduces amyloid production, increases 
      regional cerebral blood flow, and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-tau 
      activity in preclinical studies, properties that could have disease-modifying 
      effects for Alzheimer disease. We aimed to determine if nilvadipine was effective in 
      slowing cognitive decline in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: NILVAD was an 18-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
      double-blind trial that randomised participants between 15 May 2013 and 13 April 
      2015. The study was conducted at 23 academic centres in nine European countries. Of 
      577 participants screened, 511 were eligible and were randomised (258 to placebo, 
      253 to nilvadipine). Participants took a trial treatment capsule once a day after 
      breakfast for 78 weeks. Participants were aged >50 years, meeting National Institute 
      of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's disease Criteria 
      (NINCDS-ADRDA) for diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease, with a Standardised 
      Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) score of ≥12 and <27. Participants were 
      randomly assigned to 8 mg sustained-release nilvadipine or matched placebo. The a 
      priori defined primary outcome was progression on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
      Scale Cognitive Subscale-12 (ADAS-Cog 12) in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) 
      population (n = 498), with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb) 
      as a gated co-primary outcome, eligible to be promoted to primary end point 
      conditional on a significant effect on the ADAS-Cog 12. The analysis set had a mean 
      age of 73 years and was 62% female. Baseline demographic and Alzheimer 
      disease-specific characteristics were similar between treatment groups, with 
      reported mean of 1.7 years since diagnosis and mean SMMSE of 20.4. The prespecified 
      primary analyses failed to show any treatment benefit for nilvadipine on the 
      co-primary outcome (p = 0.465). Decline from baseline in ADAS-Cog 12 on placebo was 
      0.79 (95% CI, -0.07-1.64) at 13 weeks, 6.41 (5.33-7.49) at 52 weeks, and 9.63 
      (8.33-10.93) at 78 weeks and on nilvadipine was 0.88 (0.02-1.74) at 13 weeks, 5.75 
      (4.66-6.85) at 52 weeks, and 9.41 (8.09-10.73) at 78 weeks. Exploratory analyses of 
      the planned secondary outcomes showed no substantial effects, including on the 
      CDR-sb or the Disability Assessment for Dementia. Nilvadipine appeared to be safe 
      and well tolerated. Mortality was similar between groups (3 on nilvadipine, 4 on 
      placebo); higher counts of adverse events (AEs) on nilvadipine (1,129 versus 1,030), 
      and serious adverse events (SAEs; 146 versus 101), were observed. There were 14 
      withdrawals because of AEs. Major limitations of this study were that subjects had 
      established dementia and the likelihood that non-Alzheimer subjects were included 
      because of the lack of biomarker confirmation of the presence of brain amyloid. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results do not suggest benefit of nilvadipine as a treatment in a 
      population spanning mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02017340, EudraCT number 2012-002764-27.

TI  - The impact of fetal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index on childhood 
      respiratory function and atopy: a prospective case-control study.
PG  - 707-711
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2018.1499720 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To determine if an elevated fetal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility 
      index is associated with abnormal respiratory function and atopy in children aged 
      12 years.Methods: This prospective case-control study compared children that had an 
      elevated fetal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index (>90th centile) to those 
      with a normal pulsatility index (<90th centile). All subjects were delivered at 
      full-term and with appropriate growth for gestational age. Outcome measures 
      included; (i) presence of asthma and/or atopy; (ii) spirometry measurements and 
      (iii) serum C-reactive protein and leptin. Multiple regression was used to account 
      for parental smoking, childhood age, gender and socioeconomic status.Results: 174 
      children with an average age of 12.1 (±0.6 SD), 48% of who were male were included 
      in the analysis. Of the 174, 99 (57%) were in the normal umbilical artery Doppler 
      pulsatility index group and 75 (43%) elevated umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility 
      index groups. The overall proportion of subjects with asthma was 28% (48/174) and 
      atopy 56% (98/174). No association was found between elevated fetal umbilical artery 
      Doppler pulsatility index and asthma (p = .47) or atopy (p = .75) at age 12 years. 
      Similarly there was no association between FEV1(%) (p = .96), forced vital capacity 
      (FVC)(%) (p = .98), elevated serum C-reactive protein (p = .69) or leptin (p = .20) 
      and an elevated fetal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index.Conclusions: An 
      elevated umbilical artery Doppler at 28-weeks gestation in the absence of 
      prematurity or fetal growth restriction is not associated with altered respiratory 
      function or the presence of atopy in children aged 12 years. These findings support 
      the theory that such disease has a multifactorial pathophysiology.

TI  - pSTAT3 Levels Have Divergent Expression Patterns and Associations with Survival in 
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Adenocarcinoma of the Oesophagus.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19061720 [doi]
LID - 1720
AB  - Signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 is activated in cancers, 
      where it promotes growth, inflammation, angiogenesis, and inhibits apoptosis. Tissue 
      microarrays were generated using tissues from 154 patients, with oesophageal 
      adenocarcinoma (OAC) (n = 116) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 38) tumours. 
      The tissues were stained for pSTAT3 and IL-6R using immunohistochemistry. The OE33 
      (OAC) and OE21 (SCC) cell lines were treated with the STAT3 inhibitor, STATTIC. The 
      Univariate cox regression analysis revealed that a positive pSTAT3 in SCC was 
      adversely associated with survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 6.382, 95% CI 1.266⁻32.184), 
      while a protective effect was demonstrated with the higher pSTAT3 levels in OAC 
      epithelium (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.574⁻0.953). The IL-6R intensity levels were higher in 
      the SCC tumours compared with the OAC tumours for the core and leading edge tumour 
      tissue. The pSTAT3 levels correlated positively with the IL-6R levels in both the 
      OAC and SCC. The treatment of OE21 and OE33 cells with the STAT3 inhibitor STATTIC 
      in vitro resulted in decreased survival, proliferation, migration, and increased 
      apoptosis. The pSTAT3 expression was associated with adverse survival in SCC, but 
      not in the OAC patients. The inhibition of STAT3 in both of the tumour subtypes 
      resulted in alterations in the survival, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, 
      suggesting a potential role for therapeutically targeting STAT3.

TI  - Childhood central adiposity at ages 5 and 9 shows consistent relationship with that 
      of the maternal grandmother but not other grandparents.
PG  - 778-785
LID - 10.1111/ijpo.12290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of a life course approach to childhood obesity has been 
      emphasized; however, few studies can prospectively investigate relationships in 
      three-generation families. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively investigate the relationship 
      between grandparental and grandchild waist circumference (WC) at ages 5 and 9 down 
      maternal and paternal lines. METHODS: At baseline in the Lifeways Cross-Generation 
      Cohort, 1094 children were born to 1082 mothers; 585 were examined at age 5 and 298 
      at age 9. Of the total 589 children with measured WC, data were also available from 
      745 grandparents. Child WC was standardized for age and sex, and theory-based 
      hierarchical linear regression was used. RESULTS: Maternal grandmother (MGM) WC was 
      predictive of grandchild WC at both time points. At age 5, grandchild's standardized 
      birth weight (B = 0.266, p = 0.001), mother's means tested eligibility for free 
      medical care (B = 1.029, p = 0.001) and grandchild seeing maternal grandparents 
      daily (B = 0.312, p = 0.048) were significant alongside MGM WC (B = 0.015, 
      p = 0.019). At age 9, only MGM WC (B = 0.022, p = 0.033) and mother's WC (B = 0.032, 
      p = 0.005) were significant. Mediation analysis with mother's WC showed significant 
      direct relationship of MGM and grandchild WC. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective 
      cross-generational cohort shows consistent patterns of association between MGM and 
      grandchild WC, not seen in other grandparental lineages.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a healthy lifestyle package (an antenatal 
      behavior change intervention supported by smartphone application technology) on the 
      incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in overweight and obese women. 
      METHODS: Women with body mass indexes (BMIs) 25-39.9 were enrolled into this 
      randomized controlled trial. The intervention consisted of specific dietary and 
      exercise advice that addressed behavior change supported by a tailor-designed 
      smartphone application. Women in the control group received usual care. The primary 
      outcome was the incidence of GDM at 28-30 weeks of gestation. To reduce GDM from 15% 
      to 7.2%, we estimated that 506 women would be required to have 80% power to detect 
      this effect size at a significance of .05, that is, 253 in each group. RESULTS: 
      Between March 2013 and February 2016, 565 women were recruited with a mean BMI of 
      29.3 and mean gestational age of 15.5 weeks. The incidence of GDM did not differ 
      between the two groups, 37 of 241 (15.4%) in the intervention group compared with 36 
      of 257 (14.1%) in the control group (relative risk 1.1, 95% CI 0.71-1.66, P=.71). 
      CONCLUSIONS: A mobile health-supported behavioral intervention did not decrease the 
      incidence of GDM. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry,

TI  - Exercise combined with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ExACT) compared to a 
      supervised exercise programme for adults with chronic pain: study protocol for a 
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 194
LID - 10.1186/s13063-018-2543-5 [doi]
LID - 194
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form of cognitive 
      behavioural therapy, which may be beneficial for people with chronic pain. The 
      approach aims to enhance daily functioning through increased psychological 
      flexibility. Whilst the therapeutic model behind ACT appears well suited to chronic 
      pain, there is a need for further research to test its effectiveness in clinical 
      practice, particularly with regards to combining ACT with physical exercise. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: This prospective, two-armed, parallel-group, single-centre 
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) will assess the effectiveness of a combined 
      Exercise and ACT programme, in comparison to supervised exercise for chronic pain. 
      One hundred and sixty patients, aged 18 years and over, who have been diagnosed with 
      a chronic pain condition by a physician will be recruited to the trial. Participants 
      will be individually randomised to one of two 8-week, group interventions. The 
      combined group will take part in weekly psychology sessions based on the ACT 
      approach, in addition to supervised exercise classes led by a physiotherapist. The 
      control group will attend weekly supervised exercise classes but will not take part 
      in an ACT programme. The primary outcome will be pain interference at 12-week 
      follow-up, measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference Scale. Secondary 
      outcomes will include self-reported pain severity, self-perception of change, 
      patient satisfaction, quality of life, depression, anxiety and healthcare 
      utilisation. Treatment process measures will include self-efficacy, pain 
      catastrophising, fear avoidance, pain acceptance and committed action. Physical 
      activity will be measured using Fitbit Zip(TM) activity trackers. Both groups will 
      be followed up post intervention and again after 12 weeks. Estimates of treatment 
      effects at follow-up will be based on an intention-to-treat framework, implemented 
      using a linear mixed-effects model. Individual and focus group qualitative 
      interviews will be undertaken with a purposeful sample of participants to explore 
      patient experiences of both treatments. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be 
      the first RCT to examine whether combining exercise with ACT produces greater 
      benefit for patients with chronic pain, compared to a standalone supervised exercise 
      programme. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03050528 . Registered

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rate of caesarean sections at full cervical dilatation with their 
      high risk of morbidity continues to rise mirroring the overall increase in caesarean 
      section rates internationally. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to 
      determine the rate of full dilatation caesarean section in a tertiary referral unit 
      and evaluate key labour, maternal and fetal factors potentially linked to those 
      deliveries. We also assessed maternal and fetal morbidity at full dilatation 
      sections. Where possible, these were compared with successful operative vaginal 
      deliveries carried out in theatre to determine key differences. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study. We reviewed the rate of full dilatation caesarean 
      section over a 10-year period. We analysed deliveries (caesarean sections or 
      operative vaginal deliveries) in single cephalic pregnancies ≥34 weeks with 
      contemporaneously collected data from our unit's electronic database for 2015. 
      RESULTS: The rate of full dilatation caesarean section increased by over a third in 
      the ten-year period (56/6947 (0.80%) vs 92/7378 (1.24%), p = 0.01). Of 84 full 
      dilatation caesarean sections who met the inclusion criteria, 63 (75%) were 
      nulliparous and the mean maternal age was 33 (±5) years. Oxytocin was used in the 
      second stage in less than half of second stage caesarean sections (22 out of a 
      recorded 57, 38.6%). There were more fetal head malposition (occipito-posterior, or 
      occipito-transverse) at full dilatation caesarean section compared to successful 
      operative vaginal deliveries (41/46 (89.1%) vs 2/21 (9.5), p < 0.001). The rate of 
      significant postpartum haemorrhage (defined as estimated blood loss ≥1000 ml) was 
      similar in both full dilatation caesarean section and operative vaginal deliveries. 
      There was no difference in the mean birthweight at full dilatation caesarean 
      sections compared to operative vaginal delivery (3.88 kg (2.80-5.33 kg) vs 3.48 kg 
      (1.53-4.40 kg)). There was no difference in neonatal morbidity. CONCLUSION: Fetal 
      head malposition is associated with a higher risk of full dilatation caesarean 
      section. Interestingly, maternal and fetal morbidity were similar between full 
      dilatation caesarean sections and anticipated difficult operative vaginal deliveries 
      carried out in theatre. The management of labour in terms of the decision to use 
      oxytocin judiciously in hope of correcting inefficient uterine contractions and 
      continuous labour ward training, particularly the diagnosis of malposition and its 
      correction may be beneficial in reducing the rate of full dilation caesarean 
      sections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The association of maternal pregnancy diet with offspring asthma risk 
      have been reported. However, literature on longitudinal patterns of asthma risk 
      relative to intrauterine nutrient exposure is limited. We aimed to establish whether 
      vegetable, oily fish and vitamin D intake during pregnancy are associated with 
      childhood asthma risk over a 10-year period in the Irish Republic. DESIGN: 
      Mother-child pairs (n=897) from the Lifeways prospective birth cohort, with data on 
      nutrient intake during pregnancy and asthma status, respectively, were eligible for 
      inclusion in the analysis. Data on socioeconomic and morbidity indicators over 10 
      years of follow-up on mothers and the index child were collected through 
      self-administered questionnaires. Asthma status as diagnosed by the general 
      practitioner at any time point over 10 years was related to maternal vegetable, oily 
      fish and vitamin D intake during pregnancy, while adjusting for gestational age, 
      socioeconomic status, smoking at delivery, breast feeding, season of birth and 
      supplement use. Data were modelled with a marginal model on correlated observations 
      over time within individuals. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, asthma was 
      inversely associated with higher daily average intake of oily fish (OR 0.23 per 
      serving/day, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.41) and of vegetables (OR 0.96 per serving/day, 95% CI 
      0.88 to 1.05), but the confidence limits overlapped 1. A higher daily vitamin D 
      intake was associated with reduced odds of asthma (OR 0.93 per μg/day, 95% CI 0.89 
      to 0.98). CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests higher daily average intake of vitamin 
      D in pregnancy is associated with asthma risk in offspring over the first 10 years 
      of life.

TI  - Feasibility of Training Physical Therapists to Deliver the Theory-Based 
      Self-Management of Osteoarthritis and Low Back Pain Through Activity and Skills 
      (SOLAS) Intervention Within a Trial.
PG  - 95-107
LID - 10.1093/ptj/pzx105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Provider training programs are frequently underevaluated, leading to 
      ambiguity surrounding effective intervention components. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of 
      this study was to assess the effectiveness of a training program in guiding physical 
      therapists to deliver the Self-management of Osteoarthritis and Low back pain 
      through Activity and Skills (SOLAS) group education and exercise intervention 
      (ISRCTN49875385), using a communication style underpinned by self-determination 
      theory (SDT). DESIGN: This was an assessment of the intervention arm training 
      program using quantitative methods. METHODS: Thirteen physical therapists were 
      trained using mixed methods to deliver the SOLAS intervention. Training was 
      evaluated using the Kirkpatrick model: (1) Reaction-physical therapists' 
      satisfaction with training, (2) Learning-therapists' confidence in and knowledge of 
      the SDT-based communication strategies and intervention content and their skills in 
      applying the strategies during training, and (3) Behavior-8 therapists were 
      audio-recorded delivering all 6 SOLAS intervention classes (n = 48), and 2 raters 
      independently coded 50% of recordings (n = 24) using the Health Care Climate 
      Questionnaire (HCCQ), the Controlling Coach Behavior Scale (CCBS), and an 
      intervention-specific measure. RESULTS: Reaction: Physical therapists reacted well 
      to training (median [IRQ]; min-max = 4.7; [0.5]; 3.7-5.0). Learning: Physical 
      therapists' confidence in the SDT-based communication strategies and knowledge of 
      some intervention content components significantly improved. Behavior: Therapists 
      delivered the intervention in a needs-supportive manner (median HCCQ = 5.3 [1.4]; 
      3.9-6.0; median CCBS = 6.6 ([0.5]; 6.1-6.8; median intervention specific measure = 
      4.0 [1.2]; 3.2-4.9). However, "goal setting" was delivered below acceptable levels 
      by all therapists (median 2.9 [0.9]; 2.0-4.0). LIMITATIONS: The intervention group 
      only was assessed as part of the process evaluation of the feasibility trial. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Training effectively guided physical therapists to be needs-supportive 
      during delivery of the SOLAS intervention. Refinements were outlined to improve 
      future similar training programs, including greater emphasis on goal setting.

TI  - Relationships between Adaptive Behaviours, Personal Factors, and Participation of 
      Young Children.
PG  - 343-354
LID - 10.1080/01942638.2017.1406428 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine the extent to which personal factors (age, socioeconomic grouping, 
      and preterm birth) and adaptive behaviour explain the participation patterns of 
      young children. METHODS: 65 Children 2-5 years old with and without a history of 
      preterm birth and no physical or intellectual disability were selected by 
      convenience sampling from Galway University Hospital, Ireland. Interviews with 
      parents were conducted using the Adaptive Behaviour Assessment System, Second 
      Edition (ABAS-II) and the Assessment of Preschool Children's Participation (APCP). 
      Linear regression models were used to identify associations between the ABAS-II 
      scores, personal factors, and APCP scores for intensity and diversity of 
      participation. RESULTS: Adaptive behaviour explained 21% of variance in intensity of 
      play, 18% in intensity of Skill Development, 7% in intensity of Active Physical 
      Recreation, and 6% in intensity of Social Activities controlling for age, preterm 
      birth, and socioeconomic grouping. Age explained between 1% and 11% of variance in 
      intensity of participation scores. Adapted behaviour (13%), Age (17%), and 
      socioeconomic grouping (5%) explained a significant percentage of variance in 
      diversity of participation controlling for the other variables. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Adaptive behaviour had a unique contribution to children's intensity and diversity 
      of participation, suggesting its importance.

TI  - Parental population exposure to historical socioeconomic and political periods and 
      grand-child's birth weight in the Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort Study in the 
      Republic of Ireland.
PG  - 100-116
LID - 10.1016/j.ssmph.2017.11.011 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to deprived socioeconomic conditions during the peri-conception and early 
      childhood periods can have a negative long-term impact on individuals' health and 
      that of their progeny. We aimed to examine whether relatives' birth period affected 
      index-child (grand-child) birthweight status in the Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort 
      in the Republic of Ireland. Participants were 943 mothers and offspring, 890 
      fathers, 938 maternal grandmothers (MGM), 700 maternal grandfathers (MGF) 537 
      paternal grandmothers (PGM) and 553 paternal grandfathers (PGF). Index-child's 
      birthweight was sex-for-gestational age standardised (UK1990 population), and then 
      classified into low birthweight (≤10th percentile) and high-birthweight (≥90th 
      percentile) and compared against normal-birthweight (>10th to <90th percentiles). 
      Four adult birth periods were considered: The Free State (FS, 1916-1938); Emergency 
      Act (EA, 1939-1946); Post-World War-II Baby-Boom (PWWII-BB, 1947-1964); and Modern 
      Ireland (MI, 1964 onwards). Logistic regression was used to assess the crude and 
      adjusted relationship between index-child's birthweight status and relatives' birth 
      periods. Overall, there were 8.7% (n=82) index-children in the low-birthweight 
      category, 77.9% (n=735) and 13.4% (n=126) within the normal and high birthweight 
      groups respectively. Index-children whose mothers were born during the PWWII-BB had 
      higher birthweight infants (Crude OR(COR)=1.81 (1.08-3.03) which remained the case 
      only for male index-children when adjusted for co-variables (Adjusted 
      OR(AOR)=4.61(1.71-12.42)). Parents' combined PWWII-BB birth period was positively 
      associated with male index-child higher birthweight, even adjusted for maternal 
      characteristics (AOR=4.60(1.69-12.50)). MGFs born during the EA were more likely to 
      have grandchildren with low birthweight after adjustment for maternal 
      characteristics (AOR=2.45(1.03-5.85)), particularly for female index-children 
      (AOR=4.74(1.16-19.25)). Both PGMs and PGFs born during the FS period had higher 
      birthweight grandchildren, adjusted for maternal-related co-variables (PGM, 
      AOR=3.23(1.21-8.63); PGF, AOR=3.93(1.11-13.96)), with the effect of PGM more evident 
      in her granddaughter (AOR=6.53(1.25-34.04)). In conclusion, there is some evidence 
      that period of grandparental birth is associated with their grandchildren's 
      birthweights, suggesting that transgenerational exposures may be particular to 
      historical context, meriting further exploration.

TI  - Usage of unscheduled hospital care by homeless individuals in Dublin, Ireland: a 
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - e016420
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016420 [doi]
LID - e016420
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Homeless people lack a secure, stable place to live and experience 
      higher rates of serious illness than the housed population. Studies, mainly from the 
      USA, have reported increased use of unscheduled healthcare by homeless 
      individuals.We sought to compare the use of unscheduled emergency department (ED) 
      and inpatient care between housed and homeless hospital patients in a high-income 
      European setting in Dublin, Ireland. SETTING: A large university teaching hospital 
      serving the south inner city in Dublin, Ireland. Patient data are collected on an 
      electronic patient record within the hospital. PARTICIPANTS: We carried out an 
      observational cross-sectional study using data on all ED visits (n=47 174) and all 
      unscheduled admissions under the general medical take (n=7031) in 2015. PRIMARY AND 
      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The address field of the hospital's electronic patient 
      record was used to identify patients living in emergency accommodation or rough 
      sleeping (hereafter referred to as homeless). Data on demographic details, length of 
      stay and diagnoses were extracted. RESULTS: In comparison with housed individuals in 
      the hospital catchment area, homeless individuals had higher rates of ED attendance 
      (0.16 attendances per person/annum vs 3.0 attendances per person/annum, 
      respectively) and inpatient bed days (0.3 vs 4.4 bed days/person/annum). The rate of 
      leaving ED before assessment was higher in homeless individuals (40% of ED 
      attendances vs 15% of ED attendances in housed individuals). The mean age of 
      homeless medical inpatients was 44.19 years (95% CI 42.98 to 45.40), whereas that of 
      housed patients was 61.20 years (95% CI 60.72 to 61.68). Homeless patients were more 
      likely to terminate an inpatient admission against medical advice (15% of admissions 
      vs 2% of admissions in homeless individuals). CONCLUSION: Homeless patients 
      represent a significant proportion of ED attendees and medical inpatients. In 
      contrast to housed patients, the bulk of usage of unscheduled care by homeless 
      people occurs in individuals aged 25-65 years.

      enteral nutrition (EN) with supplemental eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 
      fatty acid with immune and anabolic properties, may impact on clinical and 
      nutritional outcomes. BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy is associated with significant 
      weight loss and catabolism, and negatively impacts quality of life (QL). Strategies 
      to counter sustained catabolism have therapeutic rationale. METHODS: This 
      multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT was powered on a 5% difference in 
      lean body mass (LBM) at 1 month. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 
      EN-EPA (2.2 g EPA/day) (n = 97) or isocaloric isonitrogenous standard EN (EN-S) (n = 
      94), preoperatively (5 days orally), and postoperatively via a jejunostomy until 1 
      month postdischarge. Assessments perioperatively, and at 1, 3, and 6 months included 
      weight, body mass index (BMI), body composition, muscle strength, cytokines, 
      complications, and QL. RESULTS: The median (range) nutrition support was for 51 (36 
      to 78) days, and overall compliance was 96%. For the entire cohort, a significant (P 
      < 0.005) decrease in weight (-7.4 ± 6.6 kg), BMI (-2.6 ± 2.2 kg/m), LBM 
      (-2.5 ± 8.7 kg), and fat mass (-3.4 ± 5.8 kg) was evident from preoperatively to 6 
      months. The mean (±SD) loss of LBM (kg) at 1 month was -3.7 ± 8.7 in the EN-S group, 
      compared with -5.6 ± 12.1 in the EN-EPA group (P = 0.355). Per-protocol analysis 
      revealed no difference between the EN-EPA and EN-S in any clinical, nutritional, 
      functional, QL or immune parameter at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: The thesis that 
      EPA impacts on anabolism, immune function, and clinical outcomes post-esophagectomy 
      was not supported. Compliance with home EN was excellent, but weight, muscle, and 
      fat loss was significant in 30% of patients, highlighting the complexity of 
      postoperative weight loss.

AB  - AIMS: The use of multiple geographical sites for randomised cardiovascular trials 
      may lead to important heterogeneity in treatment effects. This study aimed to 
      determine whether treatment effects from different geographical recruitment regions 
      impacted significantly on five-year MACCE rates in the SYNTAX trial. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Five-year SYNTAX results (n=1,800) were analysed for geographical 
      variability by site and country for the effect of treatment (CABG vs. PCI) on MACCE 
      rates. Fixed, random, and linear mixed models were used to test clinical covariate 
      effects, such as diabetes, lesion characteristics, and procedural factors. Comparing 
      five-year MACCE rates, the pooled odds ratio (OR) between study sites was 0.58 (95% 
      CI: 0.47-0.71), and countries 0.59 (95% CI: 0.45-0.73). By homogeneity testing, no 
      individual site (X2=93.8, p=0.051) or country differences (X2=25.7, p=0.080) were 
      observed. For random effects models, the intraclass correlation was minimal (ICC 
      site=5.1%, ICC country=1.5%, p<0.001), indicating minimal geographical 
      heterogeneity, with a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.59-0.83). Baseline risk 
      (smoking, diabetes, PAD) did not influence regional five-year MACCE outcomes (ICC 
      1.3%-5.2%), nor did revascularisation of the left main vs. three-vessel disease 
      (p=0.241), across site or country subgroups. For CABG patients, the number of 
      arterial (p=0.49) or venous (p=0.38) conduits used also made no difference. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Geographic variability has no significant treatment effect on MACCE 
      rates at five years. These findings highlight the generalisability of the five-year 
      outcomes of the SYNTAX study.

TI  - Analysing the effect of multiple sclerosis on vitamin D related biochemical markers 
      of bone remodelling.

AB  - The Irish population is at risk of vitamin D deficiency during the winter months, 
      but the secular trend over the past 40 years is for marked improvement. Multiple 
      sclerosis (MS) is common in Ireland with a latitudinal pattern favouring highest 
      incidence in northern regions; MS is linked strongly with vitamin D status as a 
      causal factor. We sought firstly to study the relationship between vitamin D status 
      and vitamin D-related bone biochemistry, and secondly to evaluate if MS had an 
      independent effect on vitamin D related markers of bone remodelling. Using a 
      case-control design of 165 pairs (MS patient and matched control) residing in three 
      different geographic regions during winter months, we measured serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), C-terminal telopeptide of 
      type I collagen (CTX) and total procollagen type I amino-terminal propeptide (PINP). 
      Given the paired case-control design, associations were explored using mixed-effects 
      linear regression analysis with the patient-control pair as a random effect and 
      after log transformation of 25OHD. A two-way interaction effect was tested for 
      vitamin D status (25OHD <30nmol/L) and the presence of MS on PTH, CTX, and PINP. In 
      the total group, just over one-third (34.5%) had 25OHD <30nmol/L. PTH was elevated 
      in 7.6%. CTX was not elevated in any case, and PINP was elevated in 4.5%. On 
      mixed-effects linear regression analysis after adjusting for confounders (age, sex, 
      renal function, and serum albumin), we demonstrated the principal determinant of 
      25OHD was geographical location (p<0.001), of PTH was 25OHD (p<0.001), of CTX was 
      PTH (p<0.001), and of PINP was PTH (p<0.001). MS did not have an independent effect 
      on PTH (p=0.921), CTX (p=0.912), or PINP (p=0.495). As regards an interaction 
      effect, the presence of MS and 25OHD <30nmol/L was not significant but tended 
      towards having lower PTH (p=0.207). In conclusion, in Ireland in winter only a 
      minority had any abnormality in the secondary indices of vitamin D deficiency, and 
      MS had no independent effect on parathyroid status or bone remodelling activity.

TI  - Pregnancy-specific stress, fetoplacental haemodynamics, and neonatal outcomes in 
      women with small for gestational age pregnancies: a secondary analysis of the 
      multicentre Prospective Observational Trial to Optimise Paediatric Health in 
      Intrauterine Growth Restriction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between maternal pregnancy-specific stress and 
      umbilical (UA PI) and middle cerebral artery pulsatility indices (MCA PI), 
      cerebroplacental ratio, absent end diastolic flow (AEDF), birthweight, prematurity, 
      neonatal intensive care unit admission and adverse obstetric outcomes in women with 
      small for gestational age pregnancies. It was hypothesised that maternal 
      pregnancy-specific stress would be associated with fetoplacental haemodynamics and 
      neonatal outcomes. DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of data collected for a 
      large-scale prospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted in 
      the seven major obstetric hospitals in Ireland and Northern Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Participants included 331 women who participated in the Prospective Observational 
      Trial to Optimise Paediatric Health in Intrauterine Growth Restriction. Women with 
      singleton pregnancies between 24 and 36 weeks gestation, estimated fetal weight 
      <10th percentile and no major structural or chromosomal abnormalities were included. 
      PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Serial Doppler ultrasound examinations of 
      the umbilical and middle cerebral arteries between 20 and 42 weeks gestation, 
      Pregnancy Distress Questionnaire (PDQ) scores between 23 and 40 weeks gestation and 
      neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Concerns about physical symptoms and body image at 35-40 
      weeks were associated with lower odds of abnormal UAPI (OR 0.826, 95% CI 0.696 to 
      0.979, p=0.028). PDQ score (OR 1.073, 95% CI 1.012 to 1.137, p=0.017), concerns 
      about birth and the baby (OR 1.143, 95% CI 1.037 to 1.260, p=0.007) and concerns 
      about physical symptoms and body image (OR 1.283, 95% CI 1.070 to 1.538, p=0.007) at 
      29-34 weeks were associated with higher odds of abnormal MCA PI. Concerns about 
      birth and the baby at 29-34 weeks (OR 1.202, 95% CI 1.018 to 1.421, p=0.030) were 
      associated with higher odds of AEDF. Concerns about physical symptoms and body image 
      at 35-40 weeks were associated with decreased odds of neonatal intensive care unit 
      admission (OR 0.635, 95% CI 0.435 to 0.927, p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      suggest that fetoplacental haemodynamics may be a mechanistic link between maternal 
      prenatal stress and fetal and neonatal well-being, but additional research is 
      required.

TI  - Predictors of adults' body mass index and the association with index child's infant 
      birth weight, in the Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort Study of a thousand families 
      in the Republic of Ireland.
PG  - 649-657

AB  - The Lifeways study is novel in having information on three generations of the same 
      families. It is well established that infant birth weight (IBW) predicts 
      individuals' risk of adult chronic disease and more recently studies report 
      cross-generation transmission of risk patterns. The aims of this analysis were to 
      examine whether adults' birth weights were associated with measures of own health 
      status or social position and to relate adults' birth weights to that of the index 
      child's IBW. Finally, we assessed whether birth weight of either adults or children 
      was associated with adult body mass index (BMI) of parents and grandparents. We 
      included 1075 children whose IBW was recorded at recruitment from hospital records 
      and 2546 adult cohort members followed from 2001 until 2014. At baseline, a 
      sub-group of 920 adults had reported own birth weight (RBW). Results showed male 
      adults' RBW were significantly higher than females' (P=0.001). Mothers' RBW was 
      significantly correlated with IBW (r=0.178, P<0.001). In mixed effects linear models 
      with BMI as the outcome variable, of all adults, and in sub-groups of adults with 
      RBW and of mothers only, the IBW was associated with adult BMI adjusting for other 
      predictors. Adults' BMI was positively associated with age (P=0.013), index child's 
      IBW (P=0.001), gender (P<0.001) but not own RBW, adjusting for family identification 
      number. When mothers were removed from the adult models however, IBW ceased to be 
      associated with BMI, a final model showed RBW being associated with adult BMI 
      (P=0.04). There are cross-generational associations in the Lifeways cohort, the 
      maternal association being stronger.

TI  - Interpregnancy weight changes and impact on pregnancy outcome in a cohort of women 
      with a macrosomic first delivery: a prospective longitudinal study.
PG  - e016193

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the median interpregnancy maternal weight change between 
      first and second pregnancies, and second and third pregnancies and to assess the 
      impact of this weight change on pregnancy outcome in a cohort of women with a 
      macrosomic first delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study conducted 
      over three pregnancies from 2007 to 2015. SETTING: Tertiary referral maternity 
      hospital, Dublin, Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Women were recruited if their first baby 
      weighed >4.0 kg. METHODS: The pregnancy outcomes in the second and third pregnancies 
      were analysed separately. Data were also analysed for both interpregnancy intervals 
      comparing outcomes for those who gained any weight, or more weight than the median, 
      with those who did not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent fetal macrosomia ≥4.0 kg 
      and gestational diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: There were 280 women who delivered a 
      third baby between 2011 and 2015. There were no differences in pregnancy outcomes 
      for the second pregnancy in women who gained interpregnancy weight compared with 
      those who did not and those who gained more interpregnancy weight than the median 
      compared with those who did not. There was a statistically significant increase in 
      birth weight ≥4.0 kg (54.0% vs 39.6% p=0.03) in those women who gained any weight 
      between the second and third pregnancies. In those women who gained more 
      interpregnancy weight than the median (1.70 kg) between a second and third 
      pregnancy, there was a significant increase in the rate of gestational diabetes 
      (6.5% vs 1.4%, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study demonstrates that 
      within this cohort maternal interpregnancy weight change between a second and third 
      pregnancy is associated with an increase in birth weight ≥4.0 kg. Additionally, a 
      gain of more weight than the median (1.70 kg) is associated with a higher rate of 
      gestational diabetes.

TI  - Co-colonisation with Aspergillus fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated 
      with poorer health in cystic fibrosis patients: an Irish registry analysis.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/s12890-017-0416-4 [doi]
LID - 70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary infection is the main cause of death in cystic fibrosis (CF). 
      Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are the most prevalent 
      fungal and bacterial pathogens isolated from the CF airway, respectively. Our aim 
      was to determine the effect of different colonisation profiles of AF and PA on the 
      clinical status of patients with CF. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from 
      the Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Ireland from 2013 was performed to determine the 
      effect of intermittent and persistent colonisation with AF or PA or co-colonisation 
      with both microorganisms on clinical outcome measures in patients with CF. Key 
      outcomes measured included forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), number 
      of hospitalisations, respiratory exacerbations and antimicrobials prescribed, and 
      complications of CF, including CF related diabetes (CFRD) and allergic 
      bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). RESULTS: The prevalence of AF and PA 
      colonisation were 11% (5% persistent, 6% intermittent) and 31% (19% persistent, 12% 
      intermittent) in the Irish CF population, respectively. Co-colonisation with both 
      pathogens was associated with a 13.8% reduction in FEV(1) (p = 0.016), higher levels 
      of exacerbations (p = 0.042), hospitalisations (p = 0.023) and antimicrobial usage 
      (p = 0.014) compared to non-colonised patients and these clinical outcomes were 
      comparable to those persistently colonised with PA. Intermittent and persistent AF 
      colonisation were not associated with poorer clinical outcomes or ABPA. Patients 
      with persistent PA had a higher prevalence of CFRD diagnosis (p = 0.012). 
      CONCLUSIONS: CF patients co-colonised with AF and PA had poor clinical outcomes 
      comparable to patients persistently colonised with PA, emphasising the clinical 
      significance of co-colonisation with these microorganisms.

TI  - Calcium intake in winter pregnancy attenuates impact of vitamin D inadequacy on 
      urine NTX, a marker of bone resorption.
PG  - 1015-1023
LID - 10.1007/s00394-017-1385-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Pregnancy is characterised by increased bone turnover, but high bone 
      turnover with resorption exceeding formation may lead to negative maternal bone 
      remodelling. Recent studies are conflicting regarding the effect of calcium on 
      skeletal health in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to examine the seasonal 
      effect of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and dietary calcium on a marker of bone 
      resorption. METHODS: This was prospective study of 205 pregnant women [two cohorts; 
      early pregnancy at 13 weeks (n = 96), and late pregnancy at 28 weeks (n = 109)]. 
      Serum 25OHD and urine cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (uNTX) were 
      measured at both time points. Intakes of vitamin D and calcium were recorded using 
      3-day food diaries at each trimester. RESULTS: Compared to summer pregnancies, 
      winter pregnancies had significantly lower 25OHD and significantly higher uNTX. 
      Higher calcium intakes were negatively correlated with uNTX in winter, but not 
      summer. In late pregnancy, compared to those reporting calcium intakes ≥1000 mg/day, 
      intakes of <1000 mg/day were associated with a greater increase in uNTX in winter 
      pregnancies than in summer (41.8 vs. 0.9%). Increasing calcium intake in winter by 
      200 mg/day predicted a 13.3% reduction in late pregnancy uNTX. CONCLUSIONS: In late 
      pregnancy, during winter months when 25OHD is inadequate, intakes of dietary calcium 
      <1000 mg/day were associated with significantly increased bone resorption (uNTX). 
      Additional dietary calcium is associated with reduced bone resorption in late 
      pregnancy, with greater effect observed in winter. Further research regarding 
      optimal dietary calcium and 25OHD in pregnancy is required, particularly for women 
      gestating through winter.

PG  - 561-567
LID - 10.1111/apa.13745 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Inflammatory cytokines may play a role in the final common pathway in the 
      pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischaemic injury in experimental models. We aimed to profile 
      the systemic pro-and anti-inflammatory response over the first week of life in term 
      infants at risk of neonatal encephalopathy. METHOD: In a tertiary referral 
      university neonatal intensive care unit, serial blood samples were analysed from 41 
      term infants (requiring resuscitation at birth) in this prospective observational 
      pilot study. Serum levels of 10 pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated 
      including interleukin(IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis 
      factor(TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
      granulocyte/colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte 
      macrophage/colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). RESULTS: Infants with neonatal 
      encephalopathy and abnormal neuroimaging (n = 15) had significantly elevated 
      granulocyte macrophage/colony-stimulating factor at 0-24 h and interleukin-8, 
      interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 at 24-48 hour. Tumour necrosis factor-α and 
      vascular endothelial growth factor levels were lower at 72-96 hour (p < 0.05). 
      Significantly elevated levels of interleukin-10 were associated with mortality. 
      CONCLUSION: Serum cytokine changes and innate immune dysregulation in the first week 
      of life may be indicators of outcome in neonatal encephalopathy but require 
      validation in larger studies.

TI  - Child Care Exposure Influences Childhood Adiposity at 2 Years: Analysis from the 
      ROLO Study.
PG  - 93-101
LID - 10.1089/chi.2016.0127 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first 2 years of life are instrumental for childhood physical 
      development. Factors contributing to childhood obesity are difficult to determine; 
      child care exposure is one to consider, by influencing food preference and physical 
      activity development. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of child care 
      exposure with adiposity at 2 years. METHODS: Data were collected as part of the 
      secondary analysis of the prospective ROLO study (randomized control trial of low 
      glycemic index diet) in Dublin, Ireland. Mothers were recruited antenatally and 
      followed up at 2 years postpartum. Maternal and childhood anthropometric data and 
      lifestyle questionnaires, reporting on child care attendance (defined as nonparental 
      care), exposure (weeks), and infant-feeding practices, were collected. RESULTS: 
      Anthropometric measures and lifestyle data were collected for 273 mothers and 
      children aged 2 years, 52.7% of whom attended child care. Child care was 
      predominately provided by a nonrelative (83.7%), either in a crèche (57%) or by a 
      childminder (26.7%). More than half (56.2%) of the children attended child care 
      part-time (≤30 hours/week). Central adiposity measures (abdominal circumference, 
      waist:height ratio) and total adiposity (sum of all skin folds) were significantly 
      elevated in children with increasing time in child care. Children provided with 
      "meals and snacks" had elevated adiposity measures versus those given "snacks or no 
      food." No difference in the infant-feeding practices was identified between the 
      child care groups. CONCLUSIONS: Children attending child care have higher total and 
      central adiposity, proportional to exposure. More research is required to 
      investigate this link to appropriately design health promotion and obesity 
      prevention programs targeting children at 2 years.

TI  - Total HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in healthy children - Associations with 
      adiposity and dietary intakes of mother and child.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity in 
      adults may be a measure of the atheroprotective property of HDL. Little however, is 
      known about HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in childhood. We aimed to investigate 
      the relationship between HDL cholesterol efflux capacity and childhood 
      anthropometrics in a longitudinal study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-five children 
      (mean age = 9.4 ± 0.4 years) were followed from birth until the age of 9 years. HDL 
      cholesterol efflux capacity was determined at age 9 by incubating serum-derived 
      HDL-supernatants with (3)H-cholesterol labeled J774 macrophages and percentage 
      efflux determined. Mothers provided dietary information by completing food frequency 
      questionnaires in early pregnancy and then 5 years later on behalf of themselves and 
      their children. Pearson's correlations and multiple regression analyses were 
      conducted to confirm independent associations with HDL efflux. There was a negative 
      correlation between HDL cholesterol efflux capacity and waist circumference at age 5 
      (r = -0.3, p = 0.01) and age 9 (r = -0.24, p = 0.04) and BMI at age 5 (r = -0.45, 
      p = 0.01) and age 9 (r = -0.19, p = 0.1). Multiple regression analysis showed that 
      BMI at age 5 remained significantly associated with reduced HDL cholesterol efflux 
      capacity (r = -0.45, p < 0.001). HDL-C was negatively correlated with 
      energy-adjusted fat intake (r = -0.24, p = 0.04) and positively correlated with 
      energy-adjusted protein (r = 0.24, p = 0.04) and starch (r = 0.29, p = 0.01) intakes 
      during pregnancy. HDL-C was not significantly correlated with children dietary 
      intake at age 5. There were no significant correlations between maternal or children 
      dietary intake and HDL cholesterol efflux capacity. CONCLUSIONS: This novel analysis 
      shows that efflux capacity is negatively associated with adiposity in early 
      childhood independent of HDL-C.

LID - S0920-9964(16)30425-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2016.09.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Formal thought disorder (FTD) is associated with poor outcome in 
      established psychotic illnesses and it can be assessed as a categorical or 
      dimensional variable. However, its influence on functional outcome and 
      hospitalisation patterns in early psychosis has not been investigated. We evaluated 
      the relationship between FTD and these outcomes in a first episode psychosis (FEP) 
      sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mixed diagnostic FEP cohort was recruited through 
      an Early Intervention in Psychosis Service in Ireland. Participants were assessed at 
      initial presentation and one year later with the MIRECC GAF to evaluate social and 
      occupational functioning domains. Disorganisation (disFTD), verbosity (verFTD) and 
      poverty (povFTD) dimensions of FTD were examined at both time points, as well as a 
      unitary FTD construct. Analyses were controlled for demographic, clinical and 
      treatment variables. RESULTS: DisFTD was the only FTD dimension associated with 
      functional outcome, specifically social functioning, on multivariate analysis 
      (beta=0.13, P<0.05). The unitary FTD construct was not associated with functional 
      outcome. DisFTD at FEP presentation predicted a greater number of hospitalisations 
      (adjusted beta=0.24, P<0.001) and prolonged inpatient admission (adjusted OR=1.08, 
      95% CI 1.02-1.15, P<0.05) following FEP. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal and dimensional 
      evaluation of FTD has a clinical utility that is distinct from a cross-sectional or 
      unitary assessment. Dimensions of FTD may map onto different domains of functioning. 
      These findings are supportive of some of the changes in DSM-V with an emphasis on 
      longitudinal and dimensional appraisal of psychopathology. Communication disorders 
      may be considered a potential target for intervention in psychotic disorders.

TI  - Placental disease and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms in trisomy 21 
      pregnancy: A case-control study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were firstly to determine the proportion 
      of placental pathology in fetuses affected by trisomy 21 (T21) using current 
      pathological descriptive terminology and secondly to examine if a correlation 
      existed between the finding of an abnormal umbilical artery Doppler (UAD) waveform, 
      the presence of T21 and defined placental pathological categories. METHODS: This 
      case-control study assessed singleton fetuses with karyotypically confirmed trisomy 
      21 where placental histopathology had been conducted from 2003 to 2015 inclusive, 
      within a university tertiary obstetric centre. This was compared with unselected 
      normal singleton control pregnancies matched within a week of gestation at delivery. 
      Data included birthweight centiles and placental histopathology. Comparisons of 
      Doppler findings across placental pathological categories were performed using 
      statistical analysis. RESULTS: 104 cases were analysed; 52 cases of trisomy 21 and 
      52 controls. Fetal vascular malperfusion (48.1% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.001) and maturation 
      defects (39.2% vs. 15.7%, p = 0.023) were more common in trisomy 21 placentas. 
      Compared with controls, trisomy 21 fetuses were more likely to have shorter 
      umbilical cords (p = 0.001) and had more UAD abnormalities. Amongst T21 pregnancies, 
      umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities are associated with the presence of maternal 
      vascular malperfusion. DISCUSSION: Fetal vascular malperfusion and maturation 
      defects are more common in trisomy 21 placentas. Abnormal umbilical artery Doppler 
      waveforms are more common in T21 and are associated with maternal vascular 
      malperfusion. Placental disease may explain the increased rate of intrauterine death 
      in T21.

TI  - European multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled trial of Nilvadipine in 
      mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease-the substudy protocols: NILVAD frailty; NILVAD 
      blood and genetic biomarkers; NILVAD cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; NILVAD cerebral 
      blood flow.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In conjunction with the NILVAD trial, a European Multicentre 
      Double-Blind Placebo Controlled trial of Nilvadipine in Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), there are four NILVAD substudies in which eligible NILVAD patients are 
      also invited to participate. The main NILVAD protocol was previously published in 
      BMJ Open (2014). The objectives of the NILVAD substudies are to determine whether 
      frailty, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood biomarker profile and Apolipoprotein E 
      (APOE) status predict response to Nilvadipine, and to investigate the effect of 
      Nilvadipine on cerebral blood flow and blood biomarkers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All 
      participants who fulfil criteria for the main NILVAD study are eligible for 
      participation in the NILVAD substudies. Participation is subject to informed consent 
      and whether the substudy is available at a particular NILVAD study site. Each 
      substudy entails extra measurements during the course of the main NILVAD study. For 
      example, in the blood and genetic biomarkers substudy, extra blood (30 mL) will be 
      collected at week 0, week 13, week 52 and week 78, while in the cerebral blood flow 
      substudy, participants will receive an MRI and transcranial Doppler measurements at 
      week 0, week 26 and week 78. In the CSF substudy, 10 mL CSF is collected at week 0 
      and week 78. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All NILVAD substudies and all subsequent 
      amendments have received ethical approval within each participating country, 
      according to national regulations. Each participant provides written consent to 
      participate. All participants remain anonymised throughout and the results of each 
      substudy will be published in an international peer reviewed journal. TRIAL

PG  - e008916

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an elevated fetal umbilical artery Doppler (UAD) 
      pulsatility index (PI) at 28 weeks' gestation, in the absence of fetal growth 
      restriction (FGR) and prematurity, is associated with adverse neurocognitive outcome 
      in children aged 12 years. METHODS: Prospective cohort study, comparing children 
      with a normal fetal UAD PI (<90th centile) (n=110) and those with an elevated PI 
      (≥90th centile) (n=40). UAD was performed at 28, 32 and 34 weeks gestation. At 
      12 years of age, all children were assessed under standardised conditions at Queen's 
      University, Belfast, UK to determine cognitive and behavioural outcomes using the 
      British Ability Score-II and Achenbach Child Behavioural Checklist Parent Rated 
      Version under standardised conditions. Regression analysis was performed, 
      controlling for confounders such as gender, socioeconomic status and age at 
      assessment. RESULTS: The mean age of follow-up was 12.4 years (±0.5 SD) with 44% of 
      children male (n=63). When UAD was assessed at 28 weeks, the elevated fetal UAD 
      group had lower scores in cognitive assessments of information processing and 
      memory. Parameters included (1) recall of objects immediate verbal (p=0.002), (2) 
      delayed verbal (p=0.008) and (3) recall of objects immediate spatial (p=0.0016). 
      There were no significant differences between the Doppler groups at 32 or 34 weeks' 
      gestation. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated UAD PI at 28 weeks' gestation in the absence of 
      FGR or prematurity is associated with lower scores of declarative memory in children 
      aged 12 years. A potential explanation for this is an element of placental 
      insufficiency in the presence of the appropriately grown fetus, which affects the 
      development of the fetal hippocampus and information processing and memory 
      long-term. These findings, however, had no impact on overall academic ability, 
      mental processing and reasoning or overall behavioural function.

AB  - Understanding the developmental course of all health issues associated with preterm 
      birth is important from an individual, clinical and public health point-of-view. 
      Both the number of preterm births and proportion of survivors have increased 
      steadily in recent years. The UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 18,818) was used to 
      examine the association of gestational age with maternal ratings of general health 
      and behavior problems at ages 5 and 11 years using binary and multinomial logistic 
      regression analyses. The association between mothers' ratings of general health and 
      behavior problems was relatively weak at each time point. Children rated as being in 
      poor general health remained constant over time (4.0 % at age 5, 3.8 % at age 11), 
      but children rated as having behavioral problems increased by almost 100 % (5.6 % at 
      5; 10.5 % at 11). A gradient of increasing risk with decreasing gestational age was 
      observed for a composite health measure (general health problems and/or behavior 
      problems) at age 5, amplified at age 11 and was strongest for those with chronic 
      problems (poor health at both age 5 and age 11). This association was found to be 
      compounded by child sex, maternal characteristics at birth (education, employment, 
      marital status) and duration of breast feeding. Integrated support to at-risk 
      families initiated during, or soon after pregnancy, may prevent chronic problems and 
      might potentially reduce long term health costs for both the individual and health 
      services.

TI  - Standardised versus Individualised Parenteral Nutrition. Further Food for Thought.
PG  - 386
AB  - Parenteral Nutrition may be prescribed as a standard PN (SPN) formulation or as an 
      individualised PN (IPN) formulation. SPN may have advantages in terms of rapid 
      availability, less prescription errors, decreased risk of infection and cost savings 
      but IPN, specifically tailored to an infants needs, may achieve better outcomes in 
      terms of nutrient intake and weight gain. The aim of our study was to determine if 
      VLBW infants in our NICU benefited from receiving IPN over currently available SPN 
      solutions. Our findings were that VLBW infants prescribed IPN received significantly 
      more amino acid (28%), glucose (6%), energy (11%) and calcium (8%) from the aqueous 
      phase of PN than had they received a similar volume of SPN. The benefits were seen 
      over all the days for which PN was administered. In conclusion, IPN was found to 
      offer significant benefits to our VLBW infants. Modifications to currently available 
      SPN would result in better SPN formulations. Our study also supported the recent 
      recommendation to reduce the calcium:phosphate ratio in PN solutions to avoid early 
      hypophosphataemia.

AB  - Numerous studies have identified the effects of prematurity on the neonate's 
      physical health, however few studies have explored the effects of prematurity on 
      both the physical and mental health of the child as they develop. Secondary analysis 
      of data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of infants (n = 18 
      818, born 2000-2002 in the United Kingdom) was performed. Effects of gestational age 
      at birth on health outcomes at 5 years were measured using parental rating of their 
      children's general health and severity of behavior problems. The association between 
      parent's general health ratings and behavior problem ratings was low: 86% of those 
      reporting serious behavior problems (5% of the sample, n = 764) rated their child as 
      being in excellent, very good, or good health. Still, a gradient of increasing risk 
      of poorer outcome with decreasing gestational age was observed for a composite 
      health measure (poor/fair health and/or serious behavior problems), suggesting an 
      association with prematurity for this composite assessment of health status. The 
      greatest contribution to the childhood composite health measure at 5 years was for 
      children born at 32-36 weeks gestation: population attributable fractions for having 
      poor outcomes was 3.4% (Bonferroni-adjusted 95% confidence interval 1.1%-6.2%), 
      compared to 1% (0.2-2.3) for birth at less than 32 weeks. Results suggest that 
      preterm children, by school entry, are not only at high risk of physical health 
      problems, but also of behavioral health problems. The recognition of, and response 
      to comprehensive health and well-being outcomes related to prematurity are important 
      in order to correctly plan and deliver adequate paediatric health services and 
      policies.

AB  - The early detection of foetal growth restriction and macrosomia is an important goal 
      of modern obstetric care. Aberrant foetal growth is an important cause of perinatal 
      morbidity and mortality. Current modalities for detecting the abnormal foetal growth 
      are often inadequate. Pulse wave analysis using applanation tonometry is a simple 
      and non-invasive test that provides information about the cardiovascular system. 
      Arterial elasticity has previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
      pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular disease. Our study examined the relationship 
      between maternal arterial elasticity and birthweight by using pulse wave analysis. 
      We discovered that increased large artery elasticity predicted a larger baby at 
      birth. Large artery elasticity therefore has the potential to act as a useful 
      screening tool which may help in the prediction of women who are at risk of aberrant 
      foetal growth.

TI  - Theory-driven group-based complex intervention to support self-management of 
      osteoarthritis and low back pain in primary care physiotherapy: protocol for a 
      cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial (SOLAS).
PG  - e010728

AB  - INTRODUCTION: International clinical guidelines consistently endorse the promotion 
      of self-management (SM), including physical activity for patients with chronic low 
      back pain (CLBP) and osteoarthritis (OA). Patients frequently receive individual 
      treatment and advice to self-manage from physiotherapists in primary care, but the 
      successful implementation of a clinical and cost-effective group SM programme is a 
      key priority for health service managers in Ireland to maximise long-term outcomes 
      and efficient use of limited and costly resources. METHODS/ANALYSIS: This protocol 
      describes an assessor-blinded cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial of a 
      group-based education and exercise intervention underpinned by self-determination 
      theory designed to support an increase in SM behaviour in patients with CLBP and OA 
      in primary care physiotherapy. The primary care clinic will be the unit of 
      randomisation (cluster), with each clinic randomised to 1 of 2 groups providing the 
      Self-management of Osteoarthritis and Low back pain through Activity and Skills 
      (SOLAS) intervention or usual individual physiotherapy. Patients are followed up at 
      6 weeks, 2 and 6 months. The primary outcomes are the (1) acceptability and demand 
      of the intervention to patients and physiotherapists, (2) feasibility and optimal 
      study design/procedures and sample size for a definitive trial. Secondary outcomes 
      include exploratory analyses of: point estimates, 95% CIs, change scores and effect 
      sizes in physical function, pain and disability outcomes; process of change in 
      target SM behaviours and selected mediators; and the cost of the intervention to 
      inform a definitive trial. ETHICS/DISSEMINATION: This feasibility trial protocol was 
      approved by the UCD Human Research Ethics-Sciences Committee (LS-13-54 
      Currie-Hurley) and research access has been granted by the Health Services Executive 
      Primary Care Research Committee in January 2014. The study findings will be 
      disseminated to the research, clinical and health service communities through 
      publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentation at national and international 
      academic and clinical conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 49875385;

AB  - Language disturbance has a central role in the presentation of psychotic disorders 
      however its relationship with functioning requires further clarification, 
      particularly in first episode psychosis (FEP). Both language disturbance and 
      functioning can be evaluated with clinician-rated and performance-based measures. We 
      aimed to investigate the concurrent association between clinician-rated and 
      performance-based measures of language disturbance and functioning in FEP. We 
      assessed 108 individuals presenting to an Early Intervention in Psychosis Service in 
      Ireland. Formal thought disorder (FTD) dimensions and bizarre idiosyncratic thinking 
      (BIT) were rated with structured assessment tools. Functioning was evaluated with a 
      performance-based instrument, a clinician-rated measure and indicators of real-world 
      functioning. The disorganisation dimension of FTD was significantly associated with 
      clinician-rated measures of occupational and social functioning (Beta=-0.19, P<0.05 
      and Beta=-0.31, P<0.01, respectively). BIT was significantly associated with the 
      performance-based measure of functioning (Beta=-0.22, P<0.05). Language disturbance 
      was of less value in predicting real-world measures of functioning. Clinician-rated 
      and performance-based assessments of language disturbance are complementary and each 
      has differential associations with functioning. Communication disorders should be 
      considered as a potential target for intervention in FEP, although further 
      evaluation of the longitudinal relationship between language disturbance and 
      functioning should be undertaken.

      mechanism similar to that of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Transcatheter 
      aortic valve implantation is associated with an increased permanent pacemaker (PPM) 
      requirement in a significant proportion of patients. We undertook a meta-analysis to 
      examine the incidence of PPM insertion associated with sutureless compared with 
      conventional surgical aortic valve replacement. METHODS: A systematic review was 
      conducted in accordance with the Prisma guidelines. All searches were performed on 
      August 10, 2014. Studies between 2007 and 2014 were included in the search. RESULTS: 
      A total of 832 patients were included in the sutureless group and 3,740 in the 
      conventional group. Aortic cross-clamp (39.8 vs 62.4 minutes; P < 0.001) and 
      cardiopulmonary bypass (64.9 vs 86.7 minutes; P = 0.002) times were shorter in the 
      sutureless group. Permanent pacemaker implantation rate was higher in the sutureless 
      cohort (9.1% vs 2.4%; P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Sutureless aortic valve prostheses 
      are associated with significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic 
      cross-clamp times and a higher incidence of PPM insertion than conventional. Further 
      investigation of the prognostic significance is required.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gender plays a role in the development of a number of cardiovascular and 
      metabolic diseases and it has been suggested that females may be more insulin 
      resistant in utero. We sought to assess the relationship between infant gender and 
      insulin resistance in a large pregnancy cohort. STUDY DESIGN: This is a secondary 
      analysis of a cohort from the ROLO randomized control trial of low GI diet in 
      pregnancy. Serum insulin, glucose and leptin were measured in early pregnancy and at 
      28 weeks. At delivery cord blood C-peptide and leptin were measured. A comparison of 
      maternal factors, fetal biometry, insulin resistance and leptin was made between 
      male and female offspring. A multivariate regression model was built to account for 
      the possible effects of maternal BMI, birthweight and original study group 
      assignment on findings. RESULTS: A total of 582 women were included in this 
      secondary analysis, of whom 304 (52.2%) gave birth to male and 278 (47.8%) gave 
      birth to female infants. Compared to male infants at birth, female infants were 
      significantly lighter, (3945 ± 436 vs. 4081± 549g, p<0.001), shorter in length 
      (52.36 ± 2.3 vs. 53.05 ± 2.4cm, p<0.001) and with smaller head circumferences (35.36 
      ± 1.5 vs. 36.10 ± 1.1cm, p<0.001) than males. On multiple regression analysis, women 
      pregnant with female fetuses were less insulin resistant in early pregnancy, i.e. 
      had lower HOMA indices (B = -0.19, p = 0.01). Additionally female fetuses had higher 
      concentrations of both cord blood leptin and C-peptide at birth when compared to 
      male offspring (B = 0.38, p<0.001 and B = 0.31, p = 0.03 respectively). CONCLUSION: 
      These findings suggest gender is a risk factor for insulin resistance in-utero. 
      Additionally, carrying a female fetus decreases the risk of insulin resistance in 
      the mother, from as early as the first trimester.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial of the effect of a head-elevation pillow on 
      intrathecal local anaesthetic spread in caesarean section.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A head-elevation pillow places a patient in a ramped posture, which 
      maximises the view of the larynx during laryngoscopy, particularly in obese 
      parturients. In our institution an elevation pillow is used pre-emptively for 
      neuraxial anaesthesia. We hypothesised that head-elevation may impair cephalad 
      spread of local anaesthetic before caesarean section resulting in a lower block or 
      longer time to achieve a T6 level. We aimed to investigate the effect of 
      head-elevation on spread of intrathecal local anaesthetics during anaesthesia for 
      caesarean section. METHODS: One-hundred parturients presenting for caesarean section 
      under combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia were randomised to either the standard 
      supine position with lateral displacement or in the supine position with lateral 
      displacement on an head-elevation pillow. Each patient received intrathecal 
      hyperbaric bupivacaine 11 mg, morphine 100 μg and fentanyl 15 μg. Patients were 
      assessed for adequacy of sensory block (T6 or higher) at 10 min. RESULTS: Sensory 
      block to T6 was achieved within 10 min in 65.9% of parturients in the Elevation 
      Pillow Group compared to 95.7% in the Control Group (P<0.05). Compared to the 
      Control Group, patients in the Elevation Pillow Group had greater requirements for 
      epidural supplementation (43.5% vs 2.1%, P<0.001) or conversion to general 
      anaesthesia (9.3% vs 0%, P<0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Use of a ramped position with an 
      head-elevation pillow following injection of the intrathecal component of a combined 
      spinal-epidural anaesthetic for scheduled caesarean section was associated with a 
      significantly lower block height at 10min.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core feature of psychosis, however 
      there are gaps in our knowledge about its prevalence and factor structure. We had 
      two aims: first, to establish the factor structure of FTD; second, to explore the 
      clinical utility of dimensions of FTD in order to further the understanding of its 
      nosology. METHODS: A cross-validation study was undertaken to establish the factor 
      structure of FTD in first episode psychosis (FEP). The relative utility of FTD 
      categories vs. dimensions across diagnostic categories was investigated. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of clinically significant FTD in this FEP sample was 21%, although 
      41% showed evidence of disorganised speech, 20% displayed verbosity and 24% 
      displayed impoverished speech. A 3-factor model was identified as the best fit for 
      FTD, with disorganisation, poverty and verbosity dimensions (GFI=0.99, RMR=0.07). 
      These dimensions of FTD accurately distinguished affective from non-affective 
      diagnostic categories. A categorical approach to FTD assessment was useful in 
      identifying markers of clinical acuteness, as identified by short duration of 
      untreated psychosis (OR=2.94, P<0.01) and inpatient treatment status (OR=3.98, 
      P<0.01). CONCLUSION: FTD is moderately prevalent and multi-dimensional in FEP. 
      Employing both a dimensional and categorical assessment of FTD gives valuable 
      clinical information, however there may be a need to revise our conceptualisation of 
      the nosology of FTD. The prognostic value of FTD, as well as its neural basis, 
      requires elucidation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primarily, to assess the performance of three statistical models in 
      predicting successful vaginal birth in patients attempting a trial of labour after 
      one previous lower segment caesarean section (TOLAC). The statistically most 
      reliable models were subsequently subjected to validation testing in a local 
      antenatal population. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was 
      performed with study data collected from the Northern Ireland Maternity Service 
      Database (NIMATs). The study population included all women that underwent a TOLAC 
      (n=385) from 2010 to 2012 in a regional UK obstetric unit. Data was collected from 
      the Northern Ireland Maternity Service Database (NIMATs). Area under the curve (AUC) 
      and correlation analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of the three prediction models 
      evaluated, AUC calculations for the Smith et al., Grobman et al. and Troyer and 
      Parisi Models were 0.74, 0.72 and 0.65, respectively. Using the Smith et al. model, 
      52% of women had a low risk of caesarean section (CS) (predicted VBAC >72%) and 20% 
      had a high risk of CS (predicted VBAC <60%), of whom 20% and 63% had delivery by CS. 
      The fit between observed and predicted outcome in this study cohort using the Smith 
      et al. and Grobman et al. models were greatest (Chi-square test, p=0.228 and 0.904), 
      validating both within the population. CONCLUSION: The Smith et al. and Grobman et 
      al. models could potentially be utilized within the UK to provide women with an 
      informed choice when deciding on mode of delivery after a previous CS.

AB  - AIM: This study aimed to assess vitamin D status, and its determinants, in 
      paediatric patients with suspected sepsis who were admitted to a paediatric 
      intensive care unit (PICU). We also investigated the association between vitamin D 
      status and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) and 
      clinical determinants were prospectively assessed in children with suspected sepsis 
      (<12 years old) admitted to the PICU. The relationship between 25OHD and clinical 
      outcomes was evaluated. Vitamin D status was also assessed in control children of a 
      similar age. RESULTS: We enrolled 120 children with suspected sepsis admitted to the 
      PICU and 30 paediatric controls. 25OHD was <50 nmol/L in 59% of the children 
      admitted to the PICU and 25OHD was lower than in the controls (47 ± 29 vs 
      66 ± 26 nmol/L, p < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, 25OHD was 
      strongly associated with culture positive sepsis (p < 0.001), the paediatric index 
      of mortality (p = 0.026) and the duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.008). 
      There was a negative correlation between 25OHD and C-reactive protein (CRP): each 
      0.1% decrease in 25OHD increased CRP (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Children admitted to 
      the PICU with suspected sepsis had lower 25OHD than controls and inadequate 25OHD 
      status was associated with confirmed sepsis and poor outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) 
      levels and outcomes in preterm infants (<32 weeks gestation). STUDY DESIGN: Serum 
      25OHD was measured in mothers and their infants within 24 hours of birth, before the 
      start of enteral vitamin D supplementation, and at discharge from the neonatal 
      intensive care unit. We evaluated the associations between vitamin D status and 
      various early preterm outcomes. RESULTS: Ninety-four preterm infants and their 
      mothers were included; 92% of the infants had a 25OHD level≤50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL), 
      and 64% had a 25OHD level<30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL). A low 25OHD level (<30 nmol/L) in 
      preterm infants at birth was associated with increased oxygen requirement (P=.008), 
      increased duration of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation during 
      resuscitation at delivery (P=.032), and greater need for assisted ventilation 
      (P=.013). CONCLUSION: We observed a high prevalence of low 25OHD (<30 nmol/L), and 
      found an association between vitamin D status and acute respiratory morbidity in 
      preterm infants after birth.

AB  - The present analysis aimed to investigate the changes in the reported portion sizes 
      (PS) of foods and beverages commonly consumed by Irish adults (18-64 years) from the 
      North South Ireland Food Consumption Survey (NSIFCS) (1997-2001) and the National 
      Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) (2008-10). Food PS, which are defined as the weight of 
      food (g) consumed per eating occasion, were calculated for comparable foods and 
      beverages in two nationally representative cross-sectional Irish food consumption 
      surveys and were published in NSIFCS and NANS. Repeated measure mixed model analysis 
      compared reported food PS at the total population level as well as subdivided by 
      sex, age, BMI and social class. A total of thirteen commonly consumed foods were 
      examined. The analysis demonstrated that PS significantly increased for five foods 
      ('white sliced bread', 'brown/wholemeal breads', 'all meat, cooked', 'poultry, 
      roasted' and 'milk'), significantly decreased for three ('potatoes', 'chips/wedges' 
      and 'ham, sliced') and did not significantly change for five foods ('processed 
      potato products', 'bacon/ham', 'cheese', 'yogurt' and 'butter/spreads') between the 
      NSIFCS and the NANS. The present study demonstrates that there was considerable 
      variation in the trends in reported food PS over this period.

TI  - Transaortic TAVI Is a Valid Alternative to Transapical Approach.
PG  - 381-90
LID - 10.1111/jocs.12527 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) can be performed 
      via a number of different anatomical approaches based on patient characteristics and 
      operator choice. The aim of this study was to compare procedural outcomes between 
      transaortic (TAo) and transapical (TA) approaches in an effort to establish whether 
      any differences exist. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the current 
      literature reporting outcomes for patients undergoing TAo and TA TAVI was performed 
      to compare outcomes using each vascular approach to valve deployment. RESULTS: A 
      total of 10 studies and 1736 patients were included. A total of 193 patients 
      underwent TAo and 1543 TA TAVI. No significant difference in 30-day mortality was 
      identified (TAo 9.4, TA 10.4 p = 0.7). There were no significant differences 
      identified between TAo and TA TAVI in procedural success rate (96.3% vs. 93.7% p = 
      0.3), stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) incidence (1.8% vs. 2.3% p = 0.7), 
      major bleed (5.8% vs. 5.5% p = 0.97) or pacemaker insertion rates (6.1% vs. 7.4% p = 
      0.56). In addition, the incidence of clinically significant paravalvular 
      regurgitation (PVR) was the same between groups (6.7% vs. 11% p = 0.43). CONCLUSION: 
      Comparison of TAo and TA approaches revealed equivalent outcomes in 30-day 
      mortality, procedural success, major bleeding, stroke/TIA incidence, pacemaker 
      insertion rates and paravalvular leak. Heart teams should be familiar with the use 
      of both TA and TAo access and tailor their selection on a case-to-case basis.

TI  - Prenatal detection of structural cardiac defects and presence of associated 
      anomalies: a retrospective observational study of 1262 fetal echocardiograms.
PG  - 577-82
LID - 10.1002/pd.4575 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to document the detection of fetal congenital 
      heart defect (CHD) in relation to the following: (1) indication for referral, (2) 
      chromosomal and (3) extracardiac abnormalities. METHOD: All fetal echocardiograms 
      performed in our institution from 2007 to 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. 
      Indication for referral, cardiac diagnosis based on the World Health Organization 
      International Classification of Diseases tenth revision criteria and the presence of 
      chromosomal and extracardiac defects were recorded. RESULTS: Of 1262 
      echocardiograms, 287 (22.7%) had CHD. Abnormal anatomy scan in pregnancies 
      originally considered to be at low risk of CHD was the best indicator for detecting 
      CHD (91.2% of positive cardiac diagnoses), compared with other indications of family 
      history (5.6%) or maternal medical disorder (3.1%). Congenital anomalies of the 
      cardiac septa comprised the largest category (n = 89), within which atrioventricular 
      septal defects were the most common anomaly (n = 36). Invasive prenatal testing was 
      performed for 126 of 287 cases, of which 44% (n = 55) had a chromosomal abnormality. 
      Of 232 fetuses without chromosomal abnormalities, 31% had an extracardiac defect 
      (n = 76). CONCLUSIONS: Most CHDs occur in pregnancies regarded to be at low risk, 
      highlighting the importance of a routine midtrimester fetal anatomy scan. Frequent 
      association of fetal CHD and chromosomal and extracardiac pathology emphasises the 
      importance of thorough evaluation of any fetus with CHD.

TI  - The phenotypic manifestations of rare genic CNVs in autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 1366-72
LID - 10.1038/mp.2014.150 [doi]
AB  - Significant evidence exists for the association between copy number variants (CNVs) 
      and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); however, most of this work has focused solely on 
      the diagnosis of ASD. There is limited understanding of the impact of CNVs on the 
      'sub-phenotypes' of ASD. The objective of this paper is to evaluate associations 
      between CNVs in differentially brain expressed (DBE) genes or genes previously 
      implicated in ASD/intellectual disability (ASD/ID) and specific sub-phenotypes of 
      ASD. The sample consisted of 1590 cases of European ancestry from the Autism Genome 
      Project (AGP) with a diagnosis of an ASD and at least one rare CNV impacting any 
      gene and a core set of phenotypic measures, including symptom severity, language 
      impairments, seizures, gait disturbances, intelligence quotient (IQ) and adaptive 
      function, as well as paternal and maternal age. Classification analyses using a 
      non-parametric recursive partitioning method (random forests) were employed to 
      define sets of phenotypic characteristics that best classify the CNV-defined groups. 
      There was substantial variation in the classification accuracy of the two sets of 
      genes. The best variables for classification were verbal IQ for the ASD/ID genes, 
      paternal age at birth for the DBE genes and adaptive function for de novo CNVs. CNVs 
      in the ASD/ID list were primarily associated with communication and language 
      domains, whereas CNVs in DBE genes were related to broader manifestations of 
      adaptive function. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the 
      associations between sub-phenotypes and CNVs genome-wide in ASD. This work 
      highlights the importance of examining the diverse sub-phenotypic manifestations of 
      CNVs in ASD, including the specific features, comorbid conditions and clinical 
      correlates of ASD that comprise underlying characteristics of the disorder.

LID - e006364
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study is a European multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of nilvadipine as a 
      disease course modifying treatment for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 
      a phase III study that will run for a period of 82 weeks with a treatment period of 
      78 weeks. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Adult patients, males and females over 50 years with 
      mild-to-moderate AD as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and 
      Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders 
      Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria, will be included in the study. It aims to 
      recruit a total of 500 patients with AD; 250 in the nilvadipine group and 250 in the 
      placebo group. Participants will be randomised to receive nilvadipine, an 8 mg 
      overencapsulated, sustained release capsule, or a matching overencapsulated placebo 
      (sugar pill) for a period of 78 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy outcome 
      measure in this study is the change in cognitive function as assessed by the 
      Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 12) from baseline to the end of 
      treatment duration (78 weeks). There are two key secondary outcome measures, the 
      Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-sb) and the Disability Assessment 
      for Dementia (DAD). If a statistically significant effect is seen in the primary 
      outcome, CDR-sb will be considered to be a coprimary end point and only the DAD will 
      contribute to the secondary outcome analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study 
      and all subsequent amendments have received ethical approval within each 
      participating country according to national regulations. Each participant will 
      provide written consent to participate in the study. All participants will remain 
      anonymised throughout and the results of the study will be published in an 
      international peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EUDRACT Reference 
      Number: 2012-002764-27.

AB  - Host genetic factors influence treatment responses to antiviral therapy in chronic 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We retrospectively investigated associations 
      between host genetic markers and treatment-induced virologic responses to dual 
      therapy with interferon-α and ribavirin in chronically infected HCV genotype 1 (g1)- 
      and genotype 3 (g3)-infected individuals. A total of 171 patients (89 HCV g1 and 82 
      HCV g3 infected) were investigated for genetic markers influencing treatment-induced 
      sustained virologic response (SVR). Overall, SVR was observed for 46/89 (52%) HCV 
      g1- and 57/82 (70%) HCV g3-infected patients. Of the 4 interleukin 28B (IL28B) 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs12979860 was the host genetic marker most 
      significantly associated with failure to achieve an SVR in HCV g1-infected 
      individuals [P=3.83×10(-4); odds ratio (OR)=5.61; confidence interval 
      (CI)=2.07-15.18] and gave a positive predictive value for treatment failure of 81.3% 
      for minor homozygotes (TT). Using additive (P=3.54×10(-4)) and dominant models 
      (P=3.83×10(-4)), a dosage effect of the T allele was observed, with the dominance 
      term not significant for this SNP. Logistic regression showed an association between 
      HLA-C1/C1 and rapid virologic response in HCV g1 infections with an OR relative to 
      the heterozygote of 10.0 (95% CI: 1.6-62.5, P=0.014). HLA-C2 homozygosity was a 
      significant predictor of nonresponse to treatment in HCV g1-infected individuals 
      (P=0.023).

TI  - The impact of preterm birth on participation in childhood occupation.
PG  - 299-306
LID - 10.1007/s00431-014-2393-4 [doi]
AB  - Outcome studies of premature babies have focused their assessments predominately on 
      neurodevelopmental impairments without relating these deficits to the impact they 
      have on a child's everyday life. This study aims to determine whether very 'preterm 
      birth alone' impacts on a child's ability to participate in and carry out childhood 
      activities. Forty-four former premature infants between 6 months and 5 years 6 
      months, born in Galway University Hospital, Ireland, without physical or 
      intellectual disability, were compared with 51 age-matched term-born infants. Study 
      infants had an average gestation of 29 weeks and birth weight of 1,145 g. Functional 
      skills were assessed using the Adaptive Behavior Assessment Scale-II and the 
      Assessment of Preschool Children's Participation. Premature infants had 
      significantly lower mean scores in overall adaptive behaviour compared to term 
      infants, regardless of whether chronological (difference = 13.6, 95% (CI) = [8.2, 
      19.1]) or corrected (difference = 6.6, 95% CI = [1.4, 11.8]) age was used. Premature 
      infants had lower mean scores in conceptual, social and practical skills, but no 
      difference was found between the groups in intensity or diversity of participation. 
      CONCLUSION: Premature infants had significantly lower scores in adaptive behaviour 
      than term infants. This measurable effect of preterm birth on 'childhood 
      occupations' merits further investigation.

TI  - Is local anesthesia the optimum strategy in retrograde transcatheter aortic valve 
      implantation? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 489-97
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1383721 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retrograde transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) can be 
      performed under local anesthesia (LA) or general anesthesia (GA); however, a wide 
      variation in practice exists. METHODS: PubMed was searched between 2009 and 2013. 
      Data were extracted from eligible studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was 
      performed using DerSimonian Laird between-study variance. RESULTS: There was no 
      statistically significant difference identified between groups based on age or 
      EuroSCORE. There was no statistically significant difference seen in all-cause 
      mortality, or complication rates between groups. Mean procedural duration was 36 
      minutes shorter in the LA group (p = 0.001). There was increased vasopressor use in 
      the GA group (odds ratio 3.92; p = 0.017). Mean hospital stay was 3.41 days shorter 
      in the LA group (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the use of LA for 
      retrograde TAVI is feasible. There are several potential benefits associated, 
      shorter procedural duration, and hospital stay with lower vasopressor requirements. 
      Further studies and randomized trials are mandatory to confirm the presented 
      findings and to identify those patients for whom LA would be appropriate.

LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2014.06.016 [doi]
AB  - There is compelling evidence for the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in 
      schizophrenia susceptibility, and it has been estimated that up to 2-3% of 
      schizophrenia cases may carry rare CNVs. Despite evidence that these events are 
      associated with an increased risk across categorical neurodevelopmental disorders, 
      there is limited understanding of the impact of CNVs on the core features of 
      disorders like schizophrenia. Our objective was to evaluate associations between 
      rare CNVs in differentially brain expressed (BE) genes and the core features and 
      clinical correlates of schizophrenia. The sample included 386 cases of Irish 
      ancestry with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, at least one rare CNV impacting any 
      gene, and a core set of phenotypic measures. Statistically significant associations 
      between deletions in differentially BE genes were found for family history of mental 
      illness (decreased prevalence of all CNVs and deletions, unadjusted and adjusted) 
      and for paternal age (increase in deletions only, unadjusted, among those with later 
      ages at birth of patient). The strong effect of a lack of a family history on BE 
      genes suggests that CNVs may comprise one pathway to schizophrenia, whereas a 
      positive family history could index other genetic mechanisms that increase 
      schizophrenia vulnerability. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of 
      the association between genome-wide CNVs and risk factors and sub-phenotypic 
      features of schizophrenia beyond cognitive function.

TI  - Fetal subcutaneous tissue measurements in pregnancy as a predictor of neonatal total 
      body composition.
PG  - 952-5
LID - 10.1002/pd.4400 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between 
      prenatal measures of subcutaneous tissue as surrogate markers of fetal nutritional 
      status and correlate them with neonatal total body composition. METHODS: This 
      prospective longitudinal study of 62 singleton pregnancies obtained serial biometry 
      and subcutaneous tissue measurements at 28, 33 and 38 weeks gestation. These 
      measurements were then correlated with neonatal body composition, which was analysed 
      using the PEAPOD™ Infant Body Composition System (Cosmed USA, Concord, CA, USA). 
      RESULTS: At 38 weeks gestation, fetal abdominal subcutaneous tissue (FAST) in 
      millimetres was significantly associated with infant fat mass at delivery (+64 g per 
      mm of FAST, p < 0.001). Thigh fat (TF) at 28 weeks gestation was associated with 
      infant fat mass at delivery (+79 g/mm TF, p = 0.023). TF at 38 weeks gestation was 
      associated with infant fat mass (+63/mm TF, p = 0.004). TF and FAST at 38 weeks were 
      also predictive of both birth weight and increased abdominal circumference (AC) 
      (p = 0.001) with FAST measurement predicting an additional 5.7 mm in AC per 
      millimetre of FAST (p = 0.002) and TF predicting an additional 6.9 mm per mm of TF 
      (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: We believe that this study further validates the use of 
      prenatal measures of subcutaneous tissue and may help to highlight fetuses at risk 
      of newborn adiposity and metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Birth weight and neonatal adiposity prediction using fractional limb volume obtained 
      with 3D ultrasound.
PG  - 44-8
LID - 10.1159/000360417 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this investigation was to study fetal thigh volume 
      throughout gestation and explore its correlation with birth weight and neonatal body 
      composition. This novel technique may improve birth weight prediction and lead to 
      improved detection rates for fetal growth restriction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Fractional thigh volume (TVol) using 3D ultrasound, fetal biometry and soft tissue 
      thickness were studied longitudinally in 42 mother-infant pairs. The percentages of 
      neonatal body fat, fat mass and fat-free mass were determined using air displacement 
      plethysmography. Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 
      Linear regression analysis showed an association between TVol and birth weight. TVol 
      at 33 weeks was also associated with neonatal fat-free mass. There was no 
      correlation between TVol and neonatal fat mass. Abdominal circumference, estimated 
      fetal weight (EFW) and EFW centile showed consistent correlations with birth weight. 
      Thigh volume demonstrated an additional independent contribution to birth weight 
      prediction when added to the EFW centile from the 38-week scan (p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Fractional TVol performed at 33 weeks gestation is correlated with birth 
      weight and neonatal lean body mass. This screening test may highlight those at risk 
      of fetal growth restriction or macrosomia.

TI  - Detection of high-sensitivity troponin in outpatients with stable pulmonary 
      hypertension identifies a subgroup at higher risk of adverse outcomes.
PG  - 31-7

LID - 10.1016/j.cardfail.2013.12.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection of elevations in cardiorenal biomarkers, such as 
      troponins, B-type natriuretic peptides (BNPs), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
      lipocalins, are associated with poor outcomes in patients hospitalized with acute 
      heart failure. Less is known about the association of these markers with adverse 
      events in chronic right ventricular dysfunction due to pulmonary hypertension, or 
      whether their measurement may improve risk assessment in the outpatient setting. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a cohort study of 108 patients attending the 
      National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit in Dublin, Ireland, from 2007 to 2009. Cox 
      proportional hazards analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves were used 
      to determine predictors of mortality and hospitalization. Death or hospitalization 
      occurred in 50 patients (46.3%) during the median study period of 4.1 years. 
      Independent predictors of mortality were: 1) decreasing 6-minute walk test (6MWT; 
      hazard ratio [HR] 12.8; P < .001); 2) BNP (HR 6.68; P < .001); and 3) highly 
      sensitive troponin (hsTnT; HR 5.48; P < .001). Adjusted hazard analyses remained 
      significant when hsTnT was added to a model with BNP and 6MWT (HR 9.26, 95% CI 
      3.61-23.79), as did the predictive ability of the model for death and 
      rehospitalization (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.81, 95% 
      CI 0.73-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of troponin using a highly sensitive assay 
      identifies a pulmonary hypertension subgroup with a poorer prognosis. hsTnT may also 
      be used in a risk prediction model to identify patients at higher risk who may 
      require escalation of targeted pulmonary vasodilator therapies and closer clinical 
      surveillance.

TI  - Is valve choice a significant determinant of paravalular leak post-transcatheter 
      aortic valve implantation? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 826-33
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt515 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) following transcatheter aortic valve 
      implantation (TAVI) is associated with poor survival. The two main valve delivery 
      systems used to date differ significantly in both structure and deployment 
      technique. The primary objective of this study was to perform a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis of studies identifying PVR in patients post-TAVI using Medtronic 
      CoreValve (MCV) and Edward Sapien (ES) valves in order to identify whether a 
      significant difference exists between valve types. The secondary objective was to 
      identify additional factors predisposing to PVR to provide an overview of the other 
      associated considerations. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the 
      current literature to identify PVR rate in patients with MCV and ES valves was 
      performed. We also sought to examine other factors predisposing to PVR. RESULTS: A 
      total of 5910 patients were identified from 9 studies. PVR rates for MCV and ES were 
      analysed. MCV was associated with a higher PVR rate of 15.75% [95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 12.48-19.32] compared with ES 3.93% [95% CI 1.05-8.38]. We separately 
      reviewed predisposing factors associated with PVR. A formal comparison of the MCV 
      and ES valve leakage rates by mixed-effects meta-regression with a fixed-effect 
      moderator variable for valve type (MCV or ES) suggested a statistically significant 
      difference in leakage rate between the two valve types (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Unfavourable anatomical and pathological factors as well as valve choice have an 
      impact on rates of PVR. Additionally, certain anatomical features dictate valve 
      choice. A direct comparison of all the predisposing factors at this time is not 
      possible and will require prospective multivariate analysis. There is, however, a 
      significant difference in the PVR rates between valves based on the published 
      observational data available to date. The ES valve associated with a lower incidence 
      of PVR overall; therefore, we conclude that valve choice is indeed a significant 
      determinant of PVR post-TAVI.

TI  - Longitudinal measurement of fetal thigh soft tissue parameters and its role in the 
      prediction of birth weight.
PG  - 945-51
LID - 10.1002/pd.4170 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to profile longitudinal changes in thigh muscle 
      and fat with gestation and to determine whether thigh measurements can improve the 
      prediction of birth weight (BW). METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study of 
      subcutaneous soft tissue measurements was conducted in 328 singleton fetuses at 28 
      and 37 weeks gestation. Estimated fetal weight (EFW) was calculated using abdominal 
      circumference, femur length, biparietal diameter, and head circumference. RESULTS: 
      The fetal abdominal subcutaneous tissue (FAST) and thigh muscle and fat show an 
      increase with gestation. At 28 weeks gestation, the abdominal circumference, thigh 
      fat, FAST, and EFW percentile were found to be significant predictors of BW. A 
      combination of EFW percentile and thigh fat were found to be the optimal 
      multivariate model at 28 weeks for predicting BW. At 37 weeks, BW prediction using 
      EFW percentile, FAST, and thigh fat was the most accurate. The results revealed 
      acceptable reproducibility for fetal thigh muscle and fat. CONCLUSION: This study 
      provides reference ranges for thigh fat and muscle at 28 and 37 weeks gestation. The 
      inclusion of fetal thigh fat in the algorithm improves the predictive power for 
      birth weight. This information is important to explore the role of fetal thigh in 
      the detection of aberrant growth.

PG  - 261-7
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.112.047936 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The response to dietary fat plays a key role in metabolic health. 
      Although this can vary widely between individuals, variation within an individual 
      and the associated contribution of phenotypic and genotypic factors to this 
      variation are less defined. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to quantify 
      within-person variation in triacylglycerol response by means of a novel variation 
      score (S(v)) and to explore the phenotypic and genotypic factors associated with 
      this score. DESIGN: Two consecutive 5-h oral-lipid-tolerance tests (OLTTs) were 
      conducted in 51 healthy adults aged 18-60 y with a BMI (in kg/m²) of 18.5 to 49.8. 
      Detailed body composition, physical function, biochemistry, and genotype data were 
      gathered. RESULTS: The postprandial triacylglycerol response profile did not differ 
      (P = 0.64) across OLTTs for the group; nor did average concentrations of functional 
      markers apolipoprotein C2 (P = 0.73) and apolipoprotein C3 (P = 0.74). S(v) was low 
      in most (82%) of the adults and was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with age, 
      fasting triacylglycerol, triacylglycerol AUC, and fasting nonessential fatty acids. 
      Significant associations were also observed between S(v) and single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms in 7 genes (APOA1, IL1α, IL1β, TLR4, TCF7L2, CCK1Rec, and STAT3) after 
      correction for phenotypic differences. CONCLUSIONS: This work showed that the 
      within-person variability in postprandial lipemic response is low in most healthy 
      adults. It also showed that variability in this response is associated with a 
      defined set of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.

TI  - Genes of the interleukin-18 pathway are associated with susceptibility to Barrett's 
      esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 1331-41
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.134 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms of the 
      interleukin-18 (IL-18) pathway to Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal 
      adenocarcinoma (EAC). Most cases of EAC arise in a background of reflux-induced BE. 
      Genetic influences in this pathway are poorly understood. IL-18 is a multifunctional 
      cytokine implicated in anti-tumor immunity. A number of polymorphisms of the IL-18 
      and IL-18 receptor-accessory protein (IL-18RAP) genes have been reported to alter 
      gene expression and have recently been linked to inflammatory processes and various 
      tumors, but have not heretofore been studied in BE and EAC. METHODS: Two IL-18 
      promoter polymorphisms -137 G/C and -607 C/A, (rs187238 and rs1946518) and one 
      IL-18RAP polymorphism (rs917997, C/T) were analyzed. Each single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) was genotyped in the following groups: EAC, BE, reflux 
      esophagitis (RE), and controls and analyzed for association with disease status. 
      RESULTS: The IL-18RAP rs917997C allele is strongly associated with a protective 
      effect in BE (P = 0.0002) and EAC (P = 6 × 10(-7)), which approaches genome-wide 
      levels of significance for allele association without incurring significant multiple 
      testing. The CC genotype at IL-18RAP locus rs917997 was associated with a protective 
      effect against esophageal disease (P = 6 × 10(-4), odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, and 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.43-0.80 for BE; and P = 2 × 10(-6), OR = 0.46, and 95% CI 
      0.34-0.64 for EAC). The genotype frequencies of IL-18-607 C/A were weakly associated 
      with BE (P = 0.02), and this trend was also seen between controls and EAC (P = 
      0.07). The CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of BE (OR = 1.45, 95% 
      CI 1.07-1.98) and approached significance for EAC (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.98-1.82). 
      Allele and genotype frequencies at these loci were not significantly different 
      between the RE group and controls. Although no significant association was observed 
      between the disease groups at the -137 G/C locus, the -137G/-607C haplotype was 
      associated with increased risk of BE (P = 0.006) with haplotype frequencies of 55% 
      in controls and 65% in BE. CONCLUSIONS: These data show a strong association of the 
      IL-18RAP SNP rs917997 locus with BE and EAC and suggestive association of the 
      Barrett's population with the IL-18-607 C/A promoter polymorphism. As both of these 
      SNPs have been demonstrated as expression quantitative trait loci affecting 
      expression of the respective genes, this strongly implicates IL-18 signaling in 
      susceptibility to BE and EAC.

TI  - Genome-wide linkage analysis of 972 bipolar pedigrees using single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms.
PG  - 818-26
LID - 10.1038/mp.2011.89 [doi]
AB  - Because of the high costs associated with ascertainment of families, most linkage 
      studies of Bipolar I disorder (BPI) have used relatively small samples. Moreover, 
      the genetic information content reported in most studies has been less than 0.6. 
      Although microsatellite markers spaced every 10 cM typically extract most of the 
      genetic information content for larger multiplex families, they can be less 
      informative for smaller pedigrees especially for affected sib pair kindreds. For 
      these reasons we collaborated to pool family resources and carried out higher 
      density genotyping. Approximately 1100 pedigrees of European ancestry were initially 
      selected for study and were genotyped by the Center for Inherited Disease Research 
      using the Illumina Linkage Panel 12 set of 6090 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Of 
      the ~1100 families, 972 were informative for further analyses, and mean information 
      content was 0.86 after pruning for linkage disequilibrium. The 972 kindreds include 
      2284 cases of BPI disorder, 498 individuals with bipolar II disorder (BPII) and 702 
      subjects with recurrent major depression. Three affection status models (ASMs) were 
      considered: ASM1 (BPI and schizoaffective disorder, BP cases (SABP) only), ASM2 
      (ASM1 cases plus BPII) and ASM3 (ASM2 cases plus recurrent major depression). Both 
      parametric and non-parametric linkage methods were carried out. The strongest 
      findings occurred at 6q21 (non-parametric pairs LOD 3.4 for rs1046943 at 119 cM) and 
      9q21 (non-parametric pairs logarithm of odds (LOD) 3.4 for rs722642 at 78 cM) using 
      only BPI and schizoaffective (SA), BP cases. Both results met genome-wide 
      significant criteria, although neither was significant after correction for multiple 
      analyses. We also inspected parametric scores for the larger multiplex families to 
      identify possible rare susceptibility loci. In this analysis, we observed 59 
      parametric LODs of 2 or greater, many of which are likely to be close to maximum 
      possible scores. Although some linkage findings may be false positives, the results 
      could help prioritize the search for rare variants using whole exome or genome 
      sequencing.

TI  - Genetic classification of populations using supervised learning.
PG  - e14802
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0014802 [doi]
LID - e14802
AB  - There are many instances in genetics in which we wish to determine whether two 
      candidate populations are distinguishable on the basis of their genetic structure. 
      Examples include populations which are geographically separated, case-control 
      studies and quality control (when participants in a study have been genotyped at 
      different laboratories). This latter application is of particular importance in the 
      era of large scale genome wide association studies, when collections of individuals 
      genotyped at different locations are being merged to provide increased power. The 
      traditional method for detecting structure within a population is some form of 
      exploratory technique such as principal components analysis. Such methods, which do 
      not utilise our prior knowledge of the membership of the candidate populations. are 
      termed unsupervised. Supervised methods, on the other hand are able to utilise this 
      prior knowledge when it is available.In this paper we demonstrate that in such cases 
      modern supervised approaches are a more appropriate tool for detecting genetic 
      differences between populations. We apply two such methods, (neural networks and 
      support vector machines) to the classification of three populations (two from 
      Scotland and one from Bulgaria). The sensitivity exhibited by both these methods is 
      considerably higher than that attained by principal components analysis and in fact 
      comfortably exceeds a recently conjectured theoretical limit on the sensitivity of 
      unsupervised methods. In particular, our methods can distinguish between the two 
      Scottish populations, where principal components analysis cannot. We suggest, on the 
      basis of our results that a supervised learning approach should be the method of 
      choice when classifying individuals into pre-defined populations, particularly in 
      quality control for large scale genome wide association studies.

TI  - Epistasis between neurochemical gene polymorphisms and risk for ADHD.
PG  - 577-82

AB  - A number of genes with function related to synaptic neurochemistry have been 
      genetically associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, 
      susceptibility to the development of common psychiatric disorders by single variants 
      acting alone, can so far only explain a small proportion of the heritability of the 
      phenotype. It has been postulated that the unexplained 'dark heritability' may at 
      least in part be due to epistatic effects, which may account for the small observed 
      marginal associations, and the difficulties with replication of positive findings. 
      We undertook a comprehensive exploration of pair-wise interactions between genetic 
      variants in 24 candidate genic regions involved in monoaminergic catabolism, 
      anabolism, release, re-uptake and signal transmission in a sample of 177 
      parent-affected child trios using a case-only design and a case-pseudocontrol design 
      using conditional logistic regression. Marker-pairs thresholded on interaction odds 
      ratio (OR) and P-value are presented. We detected a number of interaction ORs >4.0, 
      including an interesting correlation between markers in the ADRA1B and DBH genes in 
      affected individuals, and several further interesting but smaller effects. These 
      effects are no larger than you would expect by chance under the assumption of 
      independence of all pair-wise relations; however, independence is unlikely. 
      Furthermore, the size of these effects is of interest and attempts to replicate 
      these results in other samples are anticipated.

TI  - Exploration of empirical Bayes hierarchical modeling for the analysis of genome-wide 
      association study data.
PG  - 445-61
LID - 10.1093/biostatistics/kxq072 [doi]
AB  - In the analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) data, the aim is to detect 
      statistical associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the 
      disease or trait of interest. These SNPs, or the particular regions of the genome 
      they implicate, are then considered for further study. We demonstrate through a 
      comprehensive simulation study that the inclusion of additional, biologically 
      relevant information through a 2-level empirical Bayes hierachical model framework 
      offers a more robust method of detecting associated SNPs. The empirical Bayes 
      approach is an objective means of analyzing the data without the need for the 
      setting of subjective parameter estimates. This framework gives more stable 
      estimates of effects through a reduction of the variability in the usual effect 
      estimates. We also demonstrate the consequences of including additional information 
      that is not informative and examine power and false-positive rates. We apply the 
      methodology to a number of genome-wide association (GWA) data sets with the 
      inclusion of additional biological information. Our results agree with previous 
      findings and in the case of one data set (Crohn's disease) suggest an additional 
      region of interest.

TI  - A genome-wide scan for common alleles affecting risk for autism.
PG  - 4072-82
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq307 [doi]
AB  - Although autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a substantial genetic basis, most of 
      the known genetic risk has been traced to rare variants, principally copy number 
      variants (CNVs). To identify common risk variation, the Autism Genome Project (AGP) 
      Consortium genotyped 1558 rigorously defined ASD families for 1 million 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analyzed these SNP genotypes for 
      association with ASD. In one of four primary association analyses, the association 
      signal for marker rs4141463, located within MACROD2, crossed the genome-wide 
      association significance threshold of P < 5 × 10(-8). When a smaller replication 
      sample was analyzed, the risk allele at rs4141463 was again over-transmitted; yet, 
      consistent with the winner's curse, its effect size in the replication sample was 
      much smaller; and, for the combined samples, the association signal barely fell 
      below the P < 5 × 10(-8) threshold. Exploratory analyses of phenotypic subtypes 
      yielded no significant associations after correction for multiple testing. They did, 
      however, yield strong signals within several genes, KIAA0564, PLD5, POU6F2, ST8SIA2 
      and TAF1C.

TI  - Functional impact of global rare copy number variation in autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 368-72
LID - 10.1038/nature09146 [doi]
AB  - The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of conditions characterized by 
      impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication, and the presence of 
      restricted and repetitive behaviours. Individuals with an ASD vary greatly in 
      cognitive development, which can range from above average to intellectual 
      disability. Although ASDs are known to be highly heritable ( approximately 90%), the 
      underlying genetic determinants are still largely unknown. Here we analysed the 
      genome-wide characteristics of rare (<1% frequency) copy number variation in ASD 
      using dense genotyping arrays. When comparing 996 ASD individuals of European 
      ancestry to 1,287 matched controls, cases were found to carry a higher global burden 
      of rare, genic copy number variants (CNVs) (1.19 fold, P = 0.012), especially so for 
      loci previously implicated in either ASD and/or intellectual disability (1.69 fold, 
      P = 3.4 x 10(-4)). Among the CNVs there were numerous de novo and inherited events, 
      sometimes in combination in a given family, implicating many novel ASD genes such as 
      SHANK2, SYNGAP1, DLGAP2 and the X-linked DDX53-PTCHD1 locus. We also discovered an 
      enrichment of CNVs disrupting functional gene sets involved in cellular 
      proliferation, projection and motility, and GTPase/Ras signalling. Our results 
      reveal many new genetic and functional targets in ASD that may lead to final 
      connected pathways.

AB  - We present a tool that assesses the enrichment of significant associations from 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a pathway context. The SNP ratio test 
      (SRT) compares the proportion of significant to all SNPs within genes that are part 
      of a pathway and computes an empirical P-value based on comparisons to ratios in 
      datasets where the assignment of case/control status has been randomized. We applied 
      the SRT to a Parkinson's disease GWAS dataset, using the KEGG database, revealing 
      significance for Parkinson's disease and related pathways. AVAILABILITY:

TI  - Evidence that common variation in NEDD9 is associated with susceptibility to 
      late-onset Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 759-67
AB  - Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most 
      common neurodegenerative disorders and in both diseases susceptibility is known to 
      be influenced by genes. We set out to identify novel susceptibility genes for LOAD 
      by performing a large scale, multi-tiered association study testing 4692 single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). We identified a SNP within a putative transcription 
      factor binding site in the NEDD9 gene (neural precursor cell expressed, 
      developmentally down-regulated), that shows good evidence of association with 
      disease risk in four out of five LOAD samples [N = 3521, P = 5.38x10(-6), odds ratio 
      (OR) = 1.38 (1.20-1.59)] and in addition, we observed a similar pattern of 
      association in two PD sample sets [N = 1464, P = 0.0145, OR =1.31 (1.05-1.62)]. In 
      exploring a potential mechanism for the association, we observed that expression of 
      NEDD9 and APOE show a strong inverse correlation in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's 
      cases. These data implicate NEDD9 as a novel susceptibility gene for LOAD and 
      possibly PD.

TI  - Bipolar affective puerperal psychosis: genome-wide significant evidence for linkage 
      to chromosome 16.
PG  - 1099-104
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vulnerability to the triggering of bipolar episodes by childbirth 
      aggregates in families and may define a genetically relevant subtype of bipolar 
      disorder. The authors conducted a search by systematic whole genome linkage scan for 
      loci influencing vulnerability to bipolar affective puerperal psychosis. METHOD: The 
      authors selected families with bipolar disorder from their previous bipolar disorder 
      genome scan, in which there was at least one family member with a manic or psychotic 
      episode with an onset within 6 weeks of delivery. Individuals were coded as affected 
      if they had been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder; bipolar II disorder; or 
      schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, according to DSM-IV. A total of 36 pedigrees 
      contributed 54 affected sibling pairs to the cohort. A genome scan with 494 
      microsatellite markers was analyzed using GENEHUNTER and MAPMAKER/SIBS. RESULTS: A 
      genome-wide significant linkage signal was observed on chromosome 16p13, and a 
      genome-wide suggestive linkage was observed on chromosome 8q24. No significant or 
      suggestive linkage was observed in these regions in our original bipolar scan. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies chromosomal regions that are likely to harbor 
      genes that predispose individuals to bipolar affective puerperal psychosis. The 
      identification of susceptibility genes would enhance understanding of pathogenesis 
      and offer the possibility of improvements in treatment and risk prediction.

TI  - Association analysis of AKT1 and schizophrenia in a UK case control sample.
PG  - 58-65
AB  - AKT1 (V-akt murine thyoma viral oncogene homolog 1) is involved in intracellular 
      signalling pathways postulated as of aetiological importance in schizophrenia. 
      Markers in the AKT1 gene have also recently been associated with schizophrenia in 
      two samples of European origin and in Japanese and Iranian samples. Aiming to 
      replicate these findings, we examined ten SNPs spanning AKT1 in a UK case-control 
      sample (schizophrenia cases n=673, controls n=716). These included all SNPs 
      previously reported to be associated in European, Japanese and Iranian samples, 
      alone or in haplotypes, as well as additional markers defined by the Haploview 
      Tagger program (pair-wise tagging, minimum r(2)=0.8, minor allele frequency=0.02). 
      We found no association with single markers (min p=0.17). We found weak evidence for 
      association (p=0.04) with a four marker haplotype reported as significant in the 
      original positive European sample of Emamian et al. [Emamian, E.S., Hall, D., 
      Birnbaum, M.J., Karayiorgou, M., Gogos, J.A., 2004. Convergent evidence for impaired 
      AKT1-GSK3beta signaling in schizophrenia. Nat. Genet. 36, 131-137] and also an 
      overlapping three marker haplotype (p=0.016) that had previously been reported as 
      significant in a Japanese sample. Nominal p-values for these haplotypes did not 
      survive correction for multiple testing. Our study provides at best weak support for 
      the hypothesis that AKT1 is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Examination of 
      our own data and those of other groups leads us to conclude that overall, the 
      evidence for association of AKT1 as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia is 
      weakly positive, but not yet convincing.

TI  - Evidence for novel susceptibility genes for late-onset Alzheimer's disease from a 
      genome-wide association study of putative functional variants.
PG  - 865-73
AB  - This study sets out to identify novel susceptibility genes for late-onset 
      Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in a powerful set of samples from the UK and USA (1808 
      LOAD cases and 2062 controls). Allele frequencies of 17 343 gene-based putative 
      functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with 
      LOAD in a discovery case-control sample from the UK. A tiered strategy was used to 
      follow-up significant variants from the discovery sample in four independent sample 
      sets. Here, we report the identification of several candidate SNPs that show 
      significant association with LOAD. Three of the identified markers are located on 
      chromosome 19 (meta-analysis: full sample P = 6.94E - 81 to 0.0001), close to the 
      APOE gene and exhibit linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the APOEepsilon4 and 
      epsilon2/3 variants (0.09 < D'<1). Two of the three SNPs can be regarded as 
      study-wide significant (expected number of false positives reaching the observed 
      significance level less than 0.05 per study). Sixteen additional SNPs show evidence 
      for association with LOAD [P = 0.0010-0.00006; odds ratio (OR) = 1.07-1.45], several 
      of which map to known linkage regions, biological candidate genes and novel genes. 
      Four SNPs not in LD with APOE show a false positive rate of less than 2 per study, 
      one of which shows study-wide suggestive evidence taking account of 17 343 tests. 
      This is a missense mutation in the galanin-like peptide precursor gene (P = 0.00005, 
      OR = 1.2, false positive rate = 0.87).

TI  - Analyses of single marker and pairwise effects of candidate loci for rheumatoid 
      arthritis using logistic regression and random forests.
PG  - S54
AB  - Using parametric and nonparametric techniques, our study investigated the presence 
      of single locus and pairwise effects between 20 markers of the Genetic Analysis 
      Workshop 15 (GAW15) North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) candidate 
      gene data set (Problem 2), analyzing 463 independent patients and 855 controls. 
      Specifically, our work examined the correspondence between logistic regression (LR) 
      analysis of single-locus and pairwise interaction effects, and random forest (RF) 
      single and joint importance measures. For this comparison, we selected small but 
      stable RFs (500 trees), which showed strong correlations (r~0.98) between their 
      importance measures and those by RFs grown on 5000 trees. Both RF importance 
      measures captured most of the LR single-locus and pairwise interaction effects, 
      while joint importance measures also corresponded to full LR models containing main 
      and interaction effects. We furthermore showed that RF measures were particularly 
      sensitive to data imputation. The most consistent pairwise effect on rheumatoid 
      arthritis was found between two markers within MAP3K7IP2/SUMO4 on 6q25.1, although 
      LR and RFs assigned different significance levels.Within a hypothetical two-stage 
      design, pairwise LR analysis of all markers with significant RF single importance 
      would have reduced the number of possible combinations in our small data set by 61%, 
      whereas joint importance measures would have been less efficient for marker pair 
      reduction. This suggests that RF single importance measures, which are able to 
      detect a wide range of interaction effects and are computationally very efficient, 
      might be exploited as pre-screening tool for larger association studies. Follow-up 
      analysis, such as by LR, is required since RFs do not indicate high-risk genotype 
      combinations.

TI  - Combining linkage data sets for meta-analysis and mega-analysis: the GAW15 
      rheumatoid arthritis data set.
PG  - S104
AB  - We have used the genome-wide marker genotypes from Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 
      Problem 2 to explore joint evidence for genetic linkage to rheumatoid arthritis 
      across several samples. The data consisted of four high-density genome scans on 
      samples selected for rheumatoid arthritis. We cleaned the data, removed intermarker 
      linkage disequilibrium, and assembled the samples onto a common genetic map using 
      genome sequence positions as a reference for map interpolation. The individual 
      studies were combined first at the genotype level (mega-analysis) prior to a 
      multipoint linkage analysis on the combined sample, and second using the genome scan 
      meta-analysis method after linkage analysis of each sample. The two approaches were 
      compared, and give strong support to the HLA locus on chromosome 6 as a 
      susceptibility locus. Other regions of interest include loci on chromosomes 11, 2, 
      and 12.

TI  - Large-scale linkage analysis of 1302 affected relative pairs with rheumatoid 
      arthritis.
PG  - S100
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common systematic autoimmune disease and its 
      etiology is believed to have both strong genetic and environmental components. We 
      demonstrate the utility of including genetic and clinical phenotypes as covariates 
      within a linkage analysis framework to search for rheumatoid arthritis 
      susceptibility loci. The raw genotypes of 1302 affected relative pairs were combined 
      from four large family-based samples (North American Rheumatoid Arthritis 
      Consortium, United Kingdom, European Consortium on Rheumatoid Arthritis Families, 
      and Canada). The familiality of the clinical phenotypes was assessed. The affected 
      relative pairs were subjected to autosomal multipoint affected relative-pair linkage 
      analysis. Covariates were included in the linkage analysis to take account of 
      heterogeneity within the sample. Evidence of familiality was observed with age at 
      onset (p << 0.001) and rheumatoid factor (RF) IgM (p << 0.001), but not definite 
      erosions (p = 0.21). Genome-wide significant evidence for linkage was observed on 
      chromosome 6. Genome-wide suggestive evidence for linkage was observed on 
      chromosomes 13 and 20 when conditioning on age at onset, chromosome 15 conditional 
      on gender, and chromosome 19 conditional on RF IgM after allowing for multiple 
      testing of covariates.

TI  - Confirmation of association between autism and the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate 
      carrier SLC25A12 gene on chromosome 2q31.
PG  - 2182-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with childhood onset and a known 
      major genetic component. A recent study identified a highly significant association 
      between autism and a two-single-nucleotide-polymorphism haplotype in the SLC25A12 
      gene, with a homozygote genotype relative risk between 2.4 and 4.8. The authors' 
      goal was to investigate this association with autism in Irish affected child-parent 
      trios because replication in an independent sample is essential in the validation of 
      such potentially important findings. METHOD: Markers rs2056202 and rs2292813 were 
      genotyped in a total of 158 trios (442 individuals). The Transmission Disequilibrium 
      Test was used to examine these markers for association with autism. RESULTS: In 
      agreement with the recent study, the authors found significant association between 
      autism and the C alleles of both rs2056202 and rs2292813 as well as the two-marker 
      haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide replication of the association 
      between autism and SLC25A12.

TI  - Preferential transmission of paternal alleles at risk genes in 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 958-65
AB  - Family, twin, and adoption studies have demonstrated a significant genetic 
      contribution to the etiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
      Pharmacological, neuroimaging, and animal-model findings suggest imbalances in 
      monoaminergic (dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic) neurotransmission in 
      ADHD. We have examined monoaminergic candidate genes for possible genetic 
      association with ADHD in the Irish population, focusing particularly on genes of the 
      dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We have observed that several of these genes 
      are associated with ADHD, including DAT1, DBH, DRD4, DRD5, and 5HT1B. Here, we 
      present what appears to be a systematic overtransmission of paternal alleles at 
      candidate genes associated with ADHD. For the nine genes included in the analysis, 
      the overall odds ratio for paternal transmission was 2, compared with 1.3 for 
      maternal transmission (paternal vs. maternal chi 2=9.6; P=.0019). Transmission to 
      females, from either parent, was significantly stronger than to males. Possible 
      reasons for this preferential transmission include imprinting and ascertainment 
      bias, although results of further analyses show that the latter is unlikely.

TI  - Genomewide linkage scan in schizoaffective disorder: significant evidence for 
      linkage at 1q42 close to DISC1, and suggestive evidence at 22q11 and 19p13.
PG  - 1081-8
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditionally, the search for genes involved in predisposition to major 
      psychoses has proceeded with separate studies of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 
      However, twin data suggest that, in addition to genes with specificity for these 
      phenotypes, there exist genes that simultaneously influence susceptibility to 
      schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. OBJECTIVE: To 
      undertake, to our knowledge, the first systematic search for such loci. DESIGN: 
      Genomewide linkage scan. SETTING: Affected individuals were ascertained in the 
      United Kingdom and Ireland from general psychiatric inpatient and outpatient 
      services. PARTICIPANTS: The families were selected for linkage studies of either 
      schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Pedigrees were selected for the current analysis 
      where there was at least 1 member with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder, bipolar 
      type. Within these pedigrees, individuals were coded as affected if they had been 
      diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder of bipolar type, or 
      bipolar I disorder. A total of 24 pedigrees contributed 35 affected sibling pairs to 
      the sample. METHOD: A 10-centimorgan genome scan using microsatellite markers was 
      analyzed using MAPMAKER/SIBS software. RESULTS: A genomewide significant signal (LOD 
      = 3.54) was observed at chromosome 1q42 (near D1S2800), and suggestive LOD scores 
      were observed at chromosomes 22q11 (LOD = 1.96) and 19p13 (LOD = 1.85). No linkage 
      was observed in these regions in our original schizophrenia or bipolar scans in 
      individuals from the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: Our linkage findings strongly 
      support the existence of loci that influence susceptibility across the functional 
      psychosis spectrum. The DISC1 gene lies within 2.5 megabases of our peak marker on 
      chromosome 1q42 and has been previously implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar 
      disorder, and, recently, schizoaffective disorder. Follow-up of this region should 
      use samples enriched for cases of schizoaffective disorder. Our findings have 
      similar implications for the search for genetic variation on chromosome 22q11 that 
      influences susceptibility to psychosis.

TI  - Stage 2 of the Wellcome Trust UK-Irish bipolar affective disorder sibling-pair 
      genome screen: evidence for linkage on chromosomes 6q16-q21, 4q12-q21, 9p21, 
      10p14-p12 and 18q22.
PG  - 831-41
AB  - Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is a common psychiatric disorder with complex 
      genetic aetiology. We have undertaken a genome-wide scan in one of the largest 
      samples of bipolar affected sibling pairs (ASPs) using a two-stage approach 
      combining sample splitting and marker grid tightening. In this second stage 
      analysis, we have examined 17 regions that achieved a nominally significant maximum 
      likelihood LOD score (MLS) threshold of 0.74 (or 1.18 for the X-chromosome) in stage 
      one. The second stage has added 135 ASP families to bring the total stage 2 sample 
      to 395 ASPs. In total, 494 microsatellite markers have been used to screen the human 
      genome at a density of 10 cM in the first stage sample (260 ASPs) and 5 cM in the 
      second stage. Under the broad diagnostic model, two markers gave LOD scores 
      exceeding 3 with two-point analysis: D4S392 (LOD=3.30) and D10S197 (LOD=3.18). 
      Multipoint analysis demonstrated suggestive evidence of linkage between BPAD and 
      chromosomal regions 6q16-q21 (MLS=2.61) and 4q12-q21 (MLS=2.38). 6q16-q21 is of 
      particular interest because our data, together with those from two recent genome 
      scans, make this the best supported linkage region in BPAD. Further, our data show 
      evidence of a gender effect at this locus with increased sharing predominantly 
      within the male-male pairs. Our scan also provides support for linkage (MLS> or 
      =1.5) at several other regions that have been implicated in meta-analyses of bipolar 
      disorder and/or schizophrenia including 9p21, 10p14-p12 and 18q22.

TI  - Combined analysis from eleven linkage studies of bipolar disorder provides strong 
      evidence of susceptibility loci on chromosomes 6q and 8q.
PG  - 582-95
AB  - Several independent studies and meta-analyses aimed at identifying genomic regions 
      linked to bipolar disorder (BP) have failed to find clear and consistent evidence of 
      linkage regions. Our hypothesis is that combining the original genotype data 
      provides benefits of increased power and control over sources of heterogeneity that 
      outweigh the difficulty and potential pitfalls of the implementation. We conducted a 
      combined analysis using the original genotype data from 11 BP genomewide linkage 
      scans comprising 5,179 individuals from 1,067 families. Heterogeneity among studies 
      was minimized in our analyses by using uniform methods of analysis and a common, 
      standardized marker map and was assessed using novel methods developed for 
      meta-analysis of genome scans. To date, this collaboration is the largest and most 
      comprehensive analysis of linkage samples involving a psychiatric disorder. We 
      demonstrate that combining original genome-scan data is a powerful approach for the 
      elucidation of linkage regions underlying complex disease. Our results establish 
      genomewide significant linkage to BP on chromosomes 6q and 8q, which provides solid 
      information to guide future gene-finding efforts that rely on fine-mapping and 
      association approaches.

TI  - Genome scan meta-analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, part I: Methods and 
      power analysis.
PG  - 17-33
AB  - This is the first of three articles on a meta-analysis of genome scans of 
      schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) that uses the rank-based genome scan 
      meta-analysis (GSMA) method. Here we used simulation to determine the power of GSMA 
      to detect linkage and to identify thresholds of significance. We simulated 
      replicates resembling the SCZ data set (20 scans; 1,208 pedigrees) and two BPD data 
      sets using very narrow (9 scans; 347 pedigrees) and narrow (14 scans; 512 pedigrees) 
      diagnoses. Samples were approximated by sets of affected sibling pairs with 
      incomplete parental data. Genotypes were simulated and nonparametric linkage (NPL) 
      scores computed for 20 180-cM chromosomes, each containing six 30-cM bins, with 
      three markers/bin (or two, for some scans). Genomes contained 0, 1, 5, or 10 linked 
      loci, and we assumed relative risk to siblings (lambda(sibs)) values of 1.15, 1.2, 
      1.3, or 1.4. For each replicate, bins were ranked within-study by maximum NPL 
      scores, and the ranks were averaged (R(avg)) across scans. Analyses were repeated 
      with weighted ranks ((sqrt)N[genotyped cases] for each scan). Two P values were 
      determined for each R(avg): P(AvgRnk) (the pointwise probability) and P(ord) (the 
      probability, given the bin's place in the order of average ranks). GSMA detected 
      linkage with power comparable to or greater than the underlying NPL scores. 
      Weighting for sample size increased power. When no genomewide significant P values 
      were observed, the presence of linkage could be inferred from the number of bins 
      with nominally significant P(AvgRnk), P(ord), or (most powerfully) both. The results 
      suggest that GSMA can detect linkage across multiple genome scans.

TI  - Genome scan meta-analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, part III: Bipolar 
      disorder.
PG  - 49-62
AB  - Genome scans of bipolar disorder (BPD) have not produced consistent evidence for 
      linkage. The rank-based genome scan meta-analysis (GSMA) method was applied to 18 
      BPD genome scan data sets in an effort to identify regions with significant support 
      for linkage in the combined data. The two primary analyses considered available 
      linkage data for "very narrow" (i.e., BP-I and schizoaffective disorder-BP) and 
      "narrow" (i.e., adding BP-II disorder) disease models, with the ranks weighted for 
      sample size. A "broad" model (i.e., adding recurrent major depression) and 
      unweighted analyses were also performed. No region achieved genomewide statistical 
      significance by several simulation-based criteria. The most significant P values 
      (<.01) were observed on chromosomes 9p22.3-21.1 (very narrow), 10q11.21-22.1 (very 
      narrow), and 14q24.1-32.12 (narrow). Nominally significant P values were observed in 
      adjacent bins on chromosomes 9p and 18p-q, across all three disease models on 
      chromosomes 14q and 18p-q, and across two models on chromosome 8q. Relatively few 
      BPD pedigrees have been studied under narrow disease models relative to the 
      schizophrenia GSMA data set, which produced more significant results. There was no 
      overlap of the highest-ranked regions for the two disorders. The present results for 
      the very narrow model are promising but suggest that more and larger data sets are 
      needed. Alternatively, linkage might be detected in certain populations or subsets 
      of pedigrees. The narrow and broad data sets had considerable power, according to 
      simulation studies, but did not produce more highly significant evidence for 
      linkage. We note that meta-analysis can sometimes provide support for linkage but 
      cannot disprove linkage in any candidate region.

TI  - The Wellcome trust UK-Irish bipolar affective disorder sibling-pair genome screen: 
      first stage report.
PG  - 189-200
AB  - We have completed the first stage of a two-stage genome wide screen designed to 
      identify chromosomal regions that may harbour susceptibility genes for bipolar 
      affective disorder. The first stage screening sample included 509 subjects from 151 
      nuclear families recruited within the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. This 
      sample contained 154 narrowly defined affected sibling pairs (DSM-IV BPI) and 258 
      broadly defined affected sibling pairs (DSM-IV BPI, SABP, BPII, BPNOS or MDD(R)), 
      approximately two thirds of all families contained at least one other additional 
      typed individual. All individuals were genotyped using 398 highly polymorphic 
      microsatellite markers from Applied Biosystems's Linkage Mapping Set Version 2. The 
      average inter-marker distance was 9.6 cM and the mean heterozygosity was 0.78. 
      Analysis of these data using non-parametric linkage methods (MAPMAKER/SIBS) found no 
      evidence for loci of major effect and no regions reached genome-wide significance 
      for either suggestive or significant linkage. We identified 19 points across the 
      genome where the MLS exceeded a value set for follow up in our second stage screen 
      (MLS > or = 0.74 (equivalent to a nominal pointwise significance of 5%) under the 
      narrowest diagnostic model). These points were on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 
      12, 17, 18 & X. Some of these points overlapped with previous linkage reports both 
      within bipolar affective disorder and other psychiatric illnesses. Under the 
      narrowest diagnostic model, the single most significant multipoint linkage was on 
      chromosome 18 at marker D18S452 (MLS=1.54). Overall the highest MLS was 1.70 on 
      chromosome 2 at marker D2S125, under the broadest diagnostic model.

TI  - Regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration by interleukin-1beta in rat cortical 
      synaptosomes: an age-related study.
PG  - 575-9
AB  - The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is released by cells 
      during injury and stress, and increased neuronal expression of IL-1beta is a feature 
      of age-related neurodegeneration. We have recently reported that IL-1beta has a 
      biphasic effect on the K+-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) 
      in cortical synaptosomes, exerting an inhibitory effect on the K+-induced rise in 
      [Ca2+]i at lower (3.5 ng/mL) concentrations and a stimulatory effect on the 
      K+-induced rise in [Ca2+]i at higher (100 ng/mL) concentrations. In the present 
      study, we observed that the K+-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was inhibited to a similar 
      extent by the lower concentration of IL-1beta in cortical synaptosomes prepared from 
      young (3-month-old), middle-aged (12-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) rats. In 
      contrast, cortical synaptosomes prepared from the aged rats exhibited an increased 
      susceptibility to the higher concentration of IL-1beta, resulting in a marked 
      elevation in [Ca2+]i. We propose that the age-related increase in neuronal 
      concentration of IL-1beta promotes a dramatic elevation in [Ca2+]i following 
      membrane depolarization, thereby altering Ca2+ homeostasis and exacerbating neuronal 
      vulnerability to excitotoxicity.
