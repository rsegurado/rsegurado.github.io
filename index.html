	<h1>Biostatistics and Genetic Epidemiology</h1>
		<p><a href="https://www.ucd.ie">University College Dublin</a> group performing research in Biostatistics and in Statistical Genetics / Genetic Epidemiology.</p>
		<p>We conduct research into methods for compensating or correcting for bias or loss of precision arising from missing data. We also work on methods for longitudinal data analysis, for twin analyses, for genetic association on genome-scale, and methods to detect non-linear (heterogeneity or epistasis) effects.</p>

	<p><h3>University College Dublin accredited courses:</h3>

		<h4>Professional Certificate in Biostatistics</h4>
		<p>A 15 ECTS part-time, in-person certification in elementary biostatistics up to regression modeling and survival analysis.</p>

		<h4>Professional Certificate in Statistics for Human Genetics</h4>
		<p>A 15 ECTS part-time fully online course in statistical applications in the genetics of human disease.</p>

		<h4>Professional Certificate in Epidemiology and Biostatistics</h4>
		<p>A 15 ECTS part-time, in-person course in the fundamentals of biostatistics and the theory and practice of epidemiology.</p>

	<p><h3>Ongoing and pilot projects</h3>

		<p>2017 - Present
			<h4>Missing data methods</h4>
			<p>Exploration of the properties of various methods for imputation or modeling of missing data points, in a range of study designs. Originally seed-funded by the <a href="https://www.hrb-tmrn.ie">HRB-TMRN</a>.</p>

		<p>On-going
			<h4>Extremely rare variants in disease</h4>
			<p>Development of an approximate probabilistic framework for associating extremely rare or sets of extremely rare genetic variants with disease. Pilot work, and seeking funding.</p>

		<p>On-going
			<h4>Generalised linear models for GWAS</h4>
			<p>Examining the performance of a range of models for gene-mapping study designs, where a large number of models (~10<sup>7</sup>) are used in the presence of miniscule confounder effects. Pilot work, and seeking funding.</p>
